I want to hug my parents again,"I don’t know how it happened, but I lost the ability to initiate physical contact with my parents. I used to run to the door to hug my father as a kid, and snuck into my parents’ bed at dawn after a nightmare. But after my tempestuous puberty many years ago, I can’t even lean against my father without feeling awkward.

Yes the problem of not being able to communicate affection is worse with my father than with my mother. We sort of hover around each other, wanting to express affection or spend time with each other but not knowing how.

And no, I can’t “talk about it”. I’m Asian, it’s just not natural in our culture and I’m already a “tsundere”. I will cringe out of my skin and my tongue will fall off if I so much as say “I love you” and meaning it.",bropill,1614081274,braingozapzap,56,342,True,2021-02-23

how do you stop feeling like a creep because of your sexuality ?,"tw: molestation 

hey it’s a bit of a personal post but for context I’m 21 and cishet. Looking back at my past, I chilled with a lot of misogynistic dudes who kinda bullied me for being frigid and I had a serious porn and masturbation problem too. So I was basically a creep in my teens and it’s something I feel very ashamed and embarrassed about but I want to use that shame to hold myself accountable. I’m going cbt to sort out that amongst the other things that happened in my life. 

Recently I’ve started to unhealthily internalise the narrative about men being creeps and all, of course, it’s important we listen but at the same time, it’s kinda making me feel doomed or that I’m predestined to be a predator which is something I don’t want to be at all. I also realised in my past that I’ve been harassed, groped and molested by a close family member so I’m not really trying to dive into a relationship before I sort that stuff out. 

There’s times where I’m attracted to a girl and I want to approach her or I find out she’s attracted to me but I’m worried to make the first move because I might misreading cues or be perceived as a creep. I start to spiral into thinking I don’t deserve to talk/be intimate with women because I have this resentment that my sexuality is pathological and I don’t want to be that past version of myself.   

How do you bros deal with those feelings? I’ve been exercising more and focusing on myself so I’m thinking do I just forget about trying to see women romantically and just focus on myself?",bropill,1614201398,throwaway13031999,17,11,True,2021-02-24
Can I distance myself emotionally without cutting someone off?,"Hey bros. So, I (22M) have a complicated relationship with one of my best friends (28M), and I really feel like it’s only complicated on my side because I’ve become really emotionally dependent on him. 

He’s a pretty notable queer artist online and he was one of my favorites and biggest influences for a couple years before we became friends. When he followed me back, my brain exploded and we started to talk infrequently until we exchanged numbers became friends. He and I have gotten really close and he even gets me involved with the process of his art and we’ve made many plans for me to come out and visit (that have ultimately failed because of the virus). He really came into my life at a perfect time and filled a void that was missing something he had

He’s married, but they’re in a very open and trusting relationship so he and I are fairly sexual together frequently. It’s something that I enjoy, but I’ve started catching myself getting anxious when he doesn’t react to saucy messages the way I want them to because I feel like it’s a sure way of knowing he still wants me in his life. Although, part of that is nerve wracking for me because I don’t wanna think I’m fulfilling some twink fantasy of his and that’s why I’m around. But I also know that’s not true and it’s mostly my inner demons telling me that because he has told me what he likes about me and why I’m important to him. 

Anyways, what I’m getting at is that I feel like I lean in on this relationship much heavier than he does, and my emotional dependence on him isn’t something I want to have be what determines the type of day I have. I’ve created lots of art for him for like his birthday and Christmas and when he’s feeling down and frequently find myself going out of my way to check up on him when I know he’s going through it one way or another. I’m not saying I expect any of that back from him, because I know he’s an adult and freelance and has a husband and whatever, but I feel like I can’t stop myself from just pulling back and then getting surprised when I find out he’s not jumping through the same hoops. Then there’s occasions I don’t hear from him for like a week or longer at a time without notice and he just resumes business as usual online (because he has to for a living) and I notice my mood TANKING because I’m so dependent on him now and find myself resorting back to drawing pictures or taking nudes in hopes that I’ll get *something* out of him. 

I hope I’m not wording this in a way that makes me sound selfish or crazy, because most of what I’m feeling right now comes from a place of me realizing that I’m giving away a lot of myself to someone who probably has a lot already and I don’t want to have to feel dependent on him to feel good. I’m not saying I’m expecting him to do what I’m doing for him, I just need to figure out how to slow my roll because I almost feel desperate in a way. And I mean, I don’t want him out of my life necessarily, because he has been so important to me and a huge inspiration. I just want to know how I can be disciplined enough to pull back and just not put out when I want to sooooo bad. 

I honestly don’t even know what I’m looking for posting on here, I’m just bad at talking about how I feel and hoping that maybe throwing up words will lighten my load a bit. You all always seem very positive too and that’s something I could hear right now.

"My crush turned me down, and weirdly it's probably the best feeling I've had this month","I finally built up the courage to confess to my friend of three years that I had a crush on her. She was pretty shocked and then politely turned me down. Weirdly though it didn't even feel that bad. I started laughing at the whole thing with her. We had a long, good talk afterwards where we talked about our feelings, our pasts, and some other stuff. I had actually kinda anticipated this result beforehand, and I confessed to her that I was afraid if we could still be just friends afterwards, because I didn't want to lose her completely. She said that of course we will still be friends, hang out and everything.

Of course I'm a little bummed out, but I also feel surprisingly good. It feels like I can breathe more easily, like a little weight was lifted from my back. And I'm totally going to respect her feelings and stay as just friends, I'm not going to desperately pursue her any further.

First time dealing with bigoted comments from family,"Hey bros,

For a few years I’ve wanted to wear nail polish and always admired guys who pulled it off, but never had the courage to do so. I have tried it in private with my ex and she was somewhat supportive, as it was her idea, but she played it out as a joke. 

Last week, my mother was talking about our neighbours’ son. He wears nail polish and sometimes his girlfriend’s clothes. My mother and her BF were saying that it’s weird. She even said ""You better not come back home one day with nail polish and your girlfriend’s jeans on"". I didn’t react or say anything, I just didn’t know what to do or say. 

I didn’t have any courage to paint my nails before, so I have even less now. I don’t know how to feel :/ I guess I’m just looking for support or people who have experienced this kind of situation, but idk.",bropill,1614296257,ariam3435,57,191,True,2021-02-25
Having trouble getting back on the workout wagon. Any advice?,"Hey bros! 

So body positivity is really important to me, I think all bodies are beautiful, and I only want to work out so I can have muscles I'm proud of. But every time I go to the dumbbells I just...stall. I think about how hard it's going to be, how sore I'm going to feel during (not after--after is a good satisfying soreness), and how hard it's going to be to keep up the habit (because I've tried and dropped it too many times).

Things would be easier if gyms were open because I can at least get myself to the gym; it's harder to turn my room into a workout zone.

I really miss lifting weights and I want to do it again. Has anyone else had a lapse like this, and if so, have you been able to get back into it? If so, how?",bropill,1614353488,georgekahoo,37,187,True,2021-02-26

I can’t find the motivation or confidence to go outside,"I’m 15 and I’ve had trouble being in public for about a year now. Everytime I’m outside I feel nervous, like everyone’s watching me, like my mind’s always waiting for someone to make a comment on my appearance or laugh at me. I start sweating, I start walking very weirdly and lose focus. This is an even bigger inconvenience because of the fact that I live in the middle of a city, so because of that I don’t really like going out, and it’s becoming a problem. I usually go out with friends every once in a while which certainly helps, but those instances are rare because I don’t like “inviting myself” to things my friends are doing, and I also almost never get invited by them to go out. I see instagram stories of some of them together, They’ll join the discord voice chat and I’ll notice that there’s 2 or 3 of them in the same house. And I only see them about once a week.

Losing Weight,"Hey bros (I guess that's how a lot of these start so that's what I'll say),

I don't really know why I'm posting this here, it's not like an exclusive fitness subreddit. I just joined this place, and I see all of the great positivity and help around, and I thought maybe I should give this help a go. I guess I just want to say it, and internet anonymity helps me do that. So here we go:

I'm 14 years old and 200 lbs. I mean that's like the base, but I can fluctuate anywhere up to 5 lbs. more over the day. I'm 6 ft., and that basically means that my BMI is right in the middle of overweight, at roughly 27.2-27.3. I don't know what to do. I've wanted to lose weight for as long as I can remember. I always just kinda hated the way I looked, and was super jealous of all of the muscular and handsome boys around me. It just hurts every day to look and see all of these people who are fit and good looking, and I'm just not. But at the same time, I'm not morbidly obese. I'm thankful that it isn't that bad, but at the same time, it makes me feel like my problems aren't big enough, and that I'm just ungrateful. My personal issue is that I've tried to lose the weight, and it just doesn't work. I don't lose weight, that's not something I've ever been able to do. Both sides of my family have long histories of overweight people, and I've been overweight my entire life. But it's weird because there are people in my family who weren't overweight at my age, like my dad. And my parents are always telling me that if I just work at it, I'll lose the weight, and that they're overweight and we'll do it together. Well the issue for me is that they've been at a healthy weight before. They've had that experience. I haven't. I have always been overweight. The worst part is I exercise. Whenever I improve my running time, or get able to lift higher, my weight stays the same or even gets worse. And that inevitably just makes me stop trying and go back to being sedentary. I don't know what to do. I just need to see things get better. And quarantine hit me hard with a combined growth spurt and reduced activity levels. And now I'm just completely hopeless. I even started skipping meals, and I've tried multiple times to purge food to no avail. It's gotten to the point where I would rather be super underweight than overweight. I just can't keep living like this. I need to see some improvement, or I just won't be able to take losing over and over anymore.

I guess what I want to say is to anyone who feels like this, you aren't alone. As stupid and cringy as it sounds, you aren't alone in your struggle. I understand. And because I do, I know this probably won't  make you feel all that better. But I do know that I've had some good friends who really helped me out, and I just want you to feel better, even if I can't. That's all I have to say, and, if you wanna talk, my DMs are open. Have a good day, and I love you guys.",bropill,1614472331,Oso_Gigante,9,10,True,2021-02-27

How do i date if i'm unemployed?,"No job no work ambitions, only got ambitions for hobbies like weightlifting, martial arts, swimming, skiing, bicycling, jogging and other things, but those aren't jobs. I have a frugal lifestyle so i get more than enough money from welfare (ADHD disability money)  and i am independent from my parents. 

When i see people on dating advice threads the advice that most give is to have ambitions and a job. When i ask this stuff on dating related subreddits the consensus seems to be that it's bad. But i don't understand, if i'm financially independent does it really matter if i have a job or not? Ain't i more than my job? Like i'm heterosexual, i like women, women these days have jobs and very good educations, so she doesn't really need me as the breadwinner, neither do i expect her to be the breadwinner of course, better to live separately i'd imagine. I got my apartment and she has got hers, or living with parents, i don't judge.

I quit trying to date and I don't know how to talk about it or how to present myself,"I'm someone to whom no-one has ever been attracted and I've spent basically my whole adult life trying to change so as to fix that. Absolutely nothing makes a difference offline but eventually, through a huge amount of trial and error, I got to the point where I could get a handful of matches on dating apps and convert a few of them a year into a face-to-face date. The thing is that since I have nothing to offer that can't be easily found in someone who's not ugly, the only thing that works is to try to be a pleaser to an absurd degree: just constant flattery and humour and, of course, carrying most conversations entirely as if I'm auditioning for a role. I find it really demeaning and come away feeling humiliated most of the time, but it's the only thing that gets me as far as meeting someone.

I've realised that that's just the way it is, the ""market forces"" of dating, and the expectation that men have to initiate, mean that that's inevitably what I have to wade through to get anywhere. After years of this, my self-respect is destroyed and I know now that opting out is the only way I can learn to be happy with myself.

At this point, it's four months since I quit, but I'm still at square one, figuring out how to be unashamed of it. For the first time in my life, I see what people mean when they talk about role models; it seems like there's no positive version of being a man that I can fit into. I've talked to a friend and my therapist about it, but both are adamant that I should and will go back to trying.

Does anyone else here know what I mean?

Also, just for clarity, these problems are exclusive to the realm of sex and dating; making platonic friends, regardless of gender has never been a particularly big problem for me.",bropill,1612819206,ducklungerun,9,1,True,2021-02-08
Don't base your body goals on influencers and other celebrities.,"When I was 14, I was obsessed with looking muscular and super shredded. I spent lots of my time working out at the gym and looking at insta models and influencers i.e [https://www.instagram.com/tristynleeofficial/](https://www.instagram.com/tristynleeofficial/). I started puking after I ate so I could lose weight and eventually, I gave myself a eating disorder. My friends and family became very worried about me since I spent so much time pre-occupied with my body, working out and worrying about my body fat( my goal was to reach a maybe 7-9% body fat.) After a while, I was extremely fed up because while I did look better (obv not healthier though), I wasn't looking like some of the influencers I followed and used as goals. I released after time that I will never look like those influencers because

1. I don't have the genetics 2) I don't take PEDs 3) Even they don't look like their photos. They use photoshop, lighting and angles to make them look better

If you are basing your goals on an influencers(lots of young people do), realize that you will never ever look like them even if you sacrifice your time and your health. Base your goals on what's realistic. Look at your parents and your younger photos, they are a good indicator of what your genetics are capable of. Look at your dream body and cut it by half is one I heard.  I don't condemn working out, I think it is a good thing, but remember, your bicep size or your body fat or whatever random bodily aspect doesn't determine you as a person, your actions do.

How do I (21m) cope with being undatable?,"
I have tried everything I can think of to make myself attractive but none of it had any effect. I lost 80 pounds, I bought a car, I’ve maintained a job, I got better clothes, I’ve done everything I can to make myself attractive externally; and none of it worked. I personally think I have a good personality, I’m good at making people laugh and I like to think I’m somewhat charismatic so personality hasn’t really been something that I focus on. 

I’ve been on apps like tinder, bumble, and okcupid since October 2019. In that time I’ve had 0 dates, probably like 10 matches, and one person respond for more than the opener. In the last 6 or so months I have had 0 activity on any of the apps regardless of how active I am on them, Nobody wants me. I’ve had my successful friends go through my profile and try to fix it but that obviously hasn’t worked. I’ve even asked close friends out in person in the last year and you know what happened? Neither bothered to show up to the dates and neither of them let me know until several hours after said dates, I don’t blame them so we’re still friends. 

I do want to put it out there that I don’t feel bitter towards women about this or anything like that, I do not identify as an Incel, although I’m sure I fit their definition. I 100% get it and I would want nothing to do with me either. It sucks but i get it 

I spend a lot of my free time either playing games or laying in bed. I don’t really have any hobbies and I don’t really have the money to get involved with anything. I tried sketching for like 6 months but I didn’t improve so I just gave up on that too. 

I feel really bad because my therapist has been trying to get me out of this spot I’m in. I had to drop out of college because I ran out of money/am stupid and she has tried helping me find colleges or any programs that may interest me to get the ball rolling but I’ve pretty much thrown in the towel at this point. I’m thousands of dollars in debt for a degree I was too stupid to get and I’m too ugly to ever hope to be seen as anything other than subhuman so where does that leave me? Poor and ugly until I die? I’d rather just not waste anyone’s time.

I don’t really know what to do anymore. Like I said I’ve pretty much given up. The only thing I’ve been looking forward to for the past few days is when I get my next paycheck I can get high again. I have no future to look forward to and I’m past the point of hoping for a relationship or friends that care about me so I’m just planning to coast until I can’t anymore.",bropill,1612949533,Throwawayviking99,34,1,True,2021-02-10

I got a degree in Comms, but there's not much I can do with it, especially right now.  My siblings are getting masters and moving forward in their lives.  But I'm just sitting at home trying to figure out what I can do to move forward.  

I want to get back in shape and travel, but my finances are so messed up I really can't do anything.

Struggling with my dad and low self-esteem,"So at the start of the pandemic, my partner asked me to jump and I left my parents' run down house after graduating and into her mother's house so we could launch into our own lives from there.

For a long time I struggled with reconnecting with my parents, especially my dad. However, I've also gained perspective and realized my dad is verbally abusive and I owe no small amount of my negative self-talk to him.

Now that we've semi-reconnected, my partner and I got out own place, and I'm a contracted, full-time education professional; I find myself looking for baby names and realizing that none of them will sound or feel right until I have my dad's express approval that they're good names.

This man taught me to critically analyze everything I came across, to break every idea down to its constituent parts, and taught me how to appreciate nuance and genuine expression.

He fed my creativity as best he could, but he also tore me down. He tore down things I liked until they had no meaning. He dismissed all my ideas that failed to impress him.

How do I move passed needing his direct, explicit approval to feel validated in anything I create or like? I can't even pick a damn baby name without wanting to run it by him. I can't even run it by him for the anxiety he'll destroy it. 

Where does everyone else get the confidence and self-efficacy to just pick names, like something, or make something without the need to feel validated?",bropill,1612984950,Brydaro,2,1,True,2021-02-10
Resources on positive masculinity?,"I'm going through a gender crisis and I think at least part of it boils down to me not understanding masculinity.

Any fellow bros that struggle with perfectionism?,"I'm not certain if this is the right place for asking this, but I'm hoping the council of bros will have some sage advice. 

For as long as I remember, I've been an intense perfectionist. I've had people tell me it's a good thing, but I've started realizing that's it's really, really hindering me. I can't engage in any of my hobbies for long  because even little mistakes sap all the fun out of whatever I'm doing immediately. It's like my brain fixates on what could be better and I end up redoing parts over and over until I eventually give up entirely. I can't remember the last time I finished a sketch or coloring. Even some video games with a lot of freedom (minecraft, the sims, animal crossing, etc.) have the same effect.

Just realized this morning I hit 2 milestones,"Personal growth milestones are funny because they don't always happen ""suddenly"", but rather you look back and go ""oh wow, come a long way!""

So I had a couple of moments like that this morning, which feels pretty good.

First is related to sexual identity.

A random reply popped up to an old comment of mine. In it I commented about being bisexual in an anime forum. That's... not exactly the kind of environment where I should expect to be accepted. Strangers hate me completely at random when that part of myself is revealed, so it can be a bit scary. But looking back over my posts I notice A) I've been comfortable enough with that part of myself to share it whenever appropriate, and B) people are generally pretty okay with it lately.

It's a nice change - because people *hate* on bi folk. Even gay people hate on bi folk. (Actually they're even more brazen about it than straight people.) I've had some really awful experiences. It's nice to be at a place where I'm okay with it, damn the consequences, and ironically there just don't seem to be any consequences at all. Good for me, good for the world.

Second is a health thing.

I did 10 pushups! Like, real, not-cheating pushups! I did it I did it!!!!

You've no idea what this means to me. I haven't been able to do a proper pushup in at least 15 years. I could do them in high school but years of no exercise and surfing a desk created a skinny-fat physique where my knees hurt all the time and I couldn't lift anything. Pushups... nah. Wouldn't happen.

I got serious about my health a few years back and fixing the knees was easier than I expected, really only took about a month or two. But the pushup thing has been *tough.* I could lift, I could walk, I could do rows, but a proper unassisted push up was impossible. Just 100% no way.

Even a month ago I didn't want to attempt one. I was still doing them on the stairs or on my knees.

Yesterday, randomly, my trainer had me tuck one elbow under myself and do pushups with *one arm*. And I was like... wait... how is this happening? So later in the day I worked up the nerve, and with a straight torso and rigid ankles did 10 proper no-cheat pushups.

Even thinking about it now I'm getting tears in my eyes. I don't even know why. I don't even understand why I'm so emotional about it. But ... oh my god. I might be healthy. I might be able to live a healthy life. Oh my god.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway. This is so long and so inconsequential *nobody* will read it, but just thought I'd share.",bropill,1613049350,Ohigetjokes,14,1,True,2021-02-11
Dealing with guilt after realising I was with my ex for all the wrong reasons,"My ex and I split up amicably a year ago. Three weeks later she met someone and they’ve been together ever since.

If I’m honest it makes me sad that she met someone so quickly. I’m glad that she met someone, but three weeks? We were together for three years. It stung a little to find that out. 

I’ve since realised that the relationship was horribly co dependent. I think we acted more as each other’s therapists than was healthy. 

It’s not that I don’t want her happy. She has a gigantic heart and so much love to give. I really hope her new partner is with her genuinely, because I know in my heart that I was always half in, half out. 

The problem was that as much as I cared about her, and as much as we had in common, I just wasn’t that attracted to her physically. 

My psychologist told me the longer I let that simmer, the bigger an issue it would become - and he was right. I knew early on it was a problem. My life was falling apart and she was there for me, unconditionally. I latched on to that. 

It wasn’t that I wasn’t there for her either. I encouraged her to continue her studies, to start a business and to work on her issues with her family. I proof read her essays and took care of the dog when she needed a quiet night to herself. 

I know the relationship wasn’t healthy. I know that I shouldn’t have stayed if I wasn’t attracted to her. I also know that I was broken and burnt out right when we met and she was there for me. 

I can remember feeling resentment towards her. I lived alone, in a city without family around and I just resented that this woman who I wasn’t attracted too was the only person who I could be with. And that’s awful. I never want to treat someone like that again. 

Simultaneously I felt this need to care for her. She felt the same way about me. Our relationship was based in helping the other one out.

There were key moments in the relationship that she’ll remember as happy times that I just didn’t want to be there. But I put on a mask...and I don’t really know why.

I just want to forgive myself for this. I already reached out to her months ago. After starting medication and getting a diagnosis I realised just how taxing I had been. I apologised to her for how I behaved and for how much I took. She never responded, and that’s fine. I do hope she got to see it though.  

I don’t feel jealousy towards her. I still believe I made the right choice in breaking up with her.

But I’m ashamed. Ashamed that I stayed with someone for three years when I wasn’t attracted to them. That this probably filtered through in a bunch of behaviours and that I probably was a dick because I didn’t really like all of who she was. But I was in a dark place and she was there for me.

I’m so ashamed that I took as much as I did from someone who I was on the fence about. I want to let this go. I know I won’t enter another relationship like this, but I wish I could take things back. 

I just want to let go of the guilt. I’ve learned I don’t want to be like this again with anyone.",bropill,1613086773,the_shrunk,0,1,True,2021-02-11

Dating apps are trash y'all,"I've been lurking here for a few months and I've seen a lot of posts here about struggling with dating and feeling unconfident because the OPs are putting themselves out there on dating apps and aren't getting any matches, dates, or any kind of positivity out of the experience. I have used dating apps on and off over the years and while I have gotten a few dates out of them, my experience has largely been the same. Since Valentine's Day is coming up and I'm still single, I figured I'd rant about dating apps and how they generally suck and hopefully make some of y'all feel better about taking a break from them and focusing on something more beneficial to your mental health. Keep in mind that this is purely anecdotal and not a criticism of anyone who uses dating apps, it's just what my cynical mind notices when it comes to using them. If you feel I missed anything or if you disagree with me, feel free to contribute or challenge me on these opinions.

**Dating apps amplify the inherent flaws of dating.** Forming a relationship takes time and effort, whether it's romantic or just a friendship. There isn't always a checklist or hard criteria to meet to become friends or to enter a romantic relationship with someone. I can share the same hobbies, have the same political views, be physically attracted to, etc. with someone and still not want to date them or even get along as friends. On the opposite side, I could have almost nothing in common with someone and still fall in love. The method that dating apps use to get people together is based almost entirely on creating a checklist of interests and physical traits to filter and categorize people in order to find your soulmate. Now this isn’t functionally different from joining a group that shares a common interest to find romance, and the same limitations that I’m calling dating apps out on apply to this as well; but when you are picking with an increasing amount of requirements that someone has to meet, the pool of people that meet those requirements shrinks.

**The culture that has formed around dating apps is fucking cancerous.** The users and the apps themselves foster this pickup culture that is completely at odds with forming a long term relationship. Don’t get me wrong, hookups are totally fine, but it’s a completely different game than actual dating. I’ve seen apps like Bumble try to mitigate this with adding an option for “what are you looking for” that you can tag your profile with but the majority of profiles don’t even fill that shit out. Tinder is one of the worst offenders of creating this culture since the app itself pressures you to come up with a witty pickup line as a way of starting a conversation with a match. I have never once in my life used a pickup line on someone in real life and had it lead to anything worthwhile. In fact, I’ve gotten more dates off of Tinder by just saying “hey how’s it going?” than I have using anything else. Pickup lines are not a normal way of interacting with someone. Also, just due to the nature of being online and unable to see the effects of what you say, you can see some fucking insensitive and downright mean bios that people would otherwise not say out loud. The average woman would never say something like “no manlets LOL” and the average guy would never say “no fattys LOL” if there were short people or fat people around them in real life.

And last, but by far the most important point, **dating apps don’t have your best interests in mind.** [Yugopnik has a great video about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iLnZ4HCrfo&amp;ab_channel=YUGOPNIK), but I’ll paraphrase some of it here. Dating apps are designed to keep you on the app. You are told that you will find your soulmate on these apps if you just keep swiping, because that will keep you on the app and make the owners some money. But if you keep searching for the perfect other, you’ll potentially miss out on someone that would truly change your life. Constantly swiping and “hedging your bets” with multiple options is dehumanizing at its core and commodifies love itself. Your value as a person is quantified and sold on a market. It reduces love down to something more akin to animals doing a mating dance to breed. If you can’t do the dance well enough, now it feels like your entire existence is worthless. That’s just not true; your existence is not worthless just because you are struggling to find love.

Since covid has kept many of us from interacting face to face and will likely continue to do so for some time, it seems like dating apps are the only solution to meeting people. If you are using dating apps and not having any luck, I would recommend looking for mixers or speed dating events where you can actually talk to people. In my city, there’s a meetup group that does virtual events like this every weekend. Chances are there’s a group near you that does something similar. And if you’re feeling down that you’ll be alone this Valentine’s day, I would urge you to at least tell a friend or family member that you love them, or post to a sub and tell them that you love the community there. It will not go unappreciated.",bropill,1613109401,Imjusthereformemes,13,1,True,2021-02-11
I hate that other people's happiness makes me feel bitter,"So a bit of a rant here. With V's day coming up, I see friends and family making plans with their SOs and getting excited about it. Rather than think ""wow, good for them"" I start to feel bitter because I don't have that and probably won't for the foreseeable future. I start to think ""ugh what did I do to deserve to be stuck like this while those assholes get to be happy?""

It's not just relationships either. I see others finding success in their careers or learning cool new hobbies or just generally doing interesting things with their lives. And the first thing my brain does is get jealous and angry about it instead of feeling happy that my loved ones are happy.

It's so difficult to find happiness within myself Bros. Is any bro also going through the same thing as I am? I just honestly need a place to rant and talk to people.

Im a terrible human being,"Basically, last year in january i broke up with my ex girlfriend after she forced me to have sex with her. I had nightmares for most of 2020 because of her. For the past 2 or 3 months i havent had any nightmares but i just woke up and had this dream that shows how evil i really am. I remember breaking in her house and invading her privacy, collecting information about things like whether or not she has a boyfriend and other shit. I remember logging in on every social media she had and looking through all of her shit, then left. Some time later my moms telling me my ex is getting arrested and i was happy, i remember saying this exactly ""take me there. I wanna laugh at her and make her feel how worthless she is"". I know for a fact its not just dream weirdness. I think i still hate her and im horrible for it. After i woke up i started looking through her reddit. Im just a bad and evil person. I really think i would have been happy if it happened irl. It scares me. Im fucking shaking and about to cry. Thought i let her go but i really didnt. Im gonna cancel my date with this girl i met a few days ago because im just not ready for it. I dont want her hearing about my lilely returning nightmares and hatred towards my ex. I dont even conciously hate her, but whenever i hear about her i feel fear and hate and anger. Sorry for rambling bros. Ill stop writing before my roommate wakes up",bropill,1611584164,Nae_Bolonz,0,1,True,2021-01-25
Is sport really supposed to be an horrible experience ?,"[TL;DR at the bottom]

Hey bros, I know this might sound like a stupid question, but i just can't wrap my head around it.

For context, I have to take mandatory PE classes, and this trimester the two sports we're practicing are crossfit and running. I'm pretty far from being a muscular person, and I don't really intend on become one because of personal reasons. I do enjoy practicing other sports, like kayak and badminton, but not really crossfit.

Unfortunately, our sports teacher has a very... aggressive mentality, and basically says that if you're having fun while exercising or you're not on the verge of throwing up by the end of the 2h-long class we have, you're not doing it right, you're not doing enough, you're lazy. And for him it applies to both crossfit and running, as in even if you hurt yourself doing those you still gotta ""push your limits."" Another teacher told me that last year while the current sport was swimming and I passed out from lack of energy (I didn't feel very good since the start of the class, and I hadn't eaten *that much* the morning), and that event really scared the shit out of me, because I already hated that class (being almost nude in front of everyone and having to change in the same locker room as 20 other people really isn't my thing) and the teacher just acted like my passing-out was nothing and was exagerated. So I am asking your collective wiseness : is it true that ""if you're having fun you're not doing it right"" ? Is sport really supposed to be horrible to do ? Because when practice stuff like kayak and badminton outside of school I really like and it's really fun, and I mean yeah I'm not the best at either of those, so maybe it's true that I'm not doing it right.

TL;DR : sports teacher insist that you shouldn't have fun while doing sports. Is that true ?",bropill,1611589542,Blokyk,3,1,True,2021-01-25

Do you ever wear nice outfits in your house just to feel good?,"I know a lot of friends who have specific home clothing, stuff that doesn't look good but can get dirty without it being an issue. Well I've never had this habit, instead I just wear normal clothes at home and when I pull out a good outfit it just feels good, even tho I can't go anywhere now because of the lock down and university being online (not that I'm that much social anyway).


I generally have very low self esteem and I consider myself to be ugly, unfortunately one aspect that isn't under my control is the hair cause I have alopecia and I lost all hair when I was 4 years old and have been bald since. It's something that doesn't make me feel too bad overall but it's certainly a hit when it comes to look, especially because I can't even grow proper eyebrows.

Emotional and mental Paralysis,"Every time when I post on subreddit like these, many people come forward in order to provide advices and tips and this always angered me. I always got into argument with these helpful people often replying back to their advices with a nonchalant""I can't do it"", ""I can't act on your advice"" and many other variations of it.

Basically I wanted these people to feel that their advices are useless and they are helpless. I know it's wrong to do such a thing, but I don't know why did i indulged in such negative behaviour until yesterday.

Yesterday a realisation hit me regarding why I am getting furious with people who are doing their best for a person they don't even know. I realised that it has nothing to do with their advice but everything to do with my fear of not standing upto my parents especially my mother's expectations.

My mother since my childhood wanted me and my sister to excel in everything, so that she can run it in the face of her in-laws, who humiliated her and ruined her life. [For those who haven't read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/h9d9hd/what_to_do/), here's a short version of how my mother became the bitter person she's now. My mother was very bright student in her academic life and always wanted to be a civil servant. But fate had different and diabolical plans for her. After graduating she was immediately married off to my father, who was atleast more than twice her age. My mother was 20 at that time, same age as me right now. All her dreams were thrown under the bus of patriarchy and misogyny.

She was married off to my father by my paternal grandmother, because she wanted her daughter to become daughter in law of a rich and influential household. Those who don't know marriages in India especially arranged marriages are like community activities. Parents of bride ask their relatives and acquiantances to find a match. My mother's marriage occurred in similar way. Since my mother was eldest she was to be married as early as possible or the younger siblings can't get married (It's a stupid belief here in this shitty country.)


Now the aquiantance who brought my father's name, didn't investigate deep enough before bringing the name as a match. She just heard rumour that my father's family was influential and rich and brought it to my paternal grandmother. My paternal grandmother not wanting to lose the opportunity to marry her daughter into a rich household, also didn't investigated my father's family and quick married my mother to my father.

The irony hit my mother and grandmother hard when they got to know that my father's family lied about their status. My father was living in a dilapidated apartment. He was suffering from variety of diseases of skin, liver and stomach due to careless lifestyle in youth. My father's family lied because they just wanted a caretaker for my father and nothing else. They also hid the fact that my father was married twice before and had a son. His earlier marriage broke because of the medival era level of patriarchy and misogyny of my father's family and their control freak nature.

My mother tried to fight all this injustice, but she couldn't do anything other than accepting the fate and the humiliation coupled with it like getting beaten by my father or getting threatened with a gun by the brother in law for speaking I'll of my father's family in front of my father.

You all must be thinking where I am going with this sob story. But I assure you this sob story contains the origins of my fears. Now comming back to the main post. My mother because of being a near valedictorian in her academic life expect the same from me and my sister. Because she failed in race of life she wants us to be successful no matter what. She doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand that [a child going through this everyday of his 20yrs of life would have developed some sort of issues](https://m.soundcloud.com/user-578003743/sounds-from-saturday-night/s-MjLRCqPjcfs?ref=clipboard&amp;p=a&amp;c=1). She thinks that  because she sacrificed her life by not breaking the marriage and going on with it despite of the humiliation, she is owed complete and unquestionable obedience, even if she did [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/hkfb39/a_pencil/), [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/i14h9p/my_mothers_courtesy/), [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/i7xdsm/my_mother_just_laughingly_said_that_people_like/), or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiveparents/comments/i1riiy/today_what_i_fear_the_most_happened_in_order_to/). She wants us to be completely subversive, because as she say she has to go through all of this because of me and my sister and especially me because I am elder, so if I haven't born or born a still birth she could have left my father.

My mother wants utter perfection and doesn't tolerate carelessness. She always pick out faults and flaws in whatever me and my sister do. She wants thing to be according to her and our opinion doesn't matter. Whenever we are on call with some friend or teacher. She wants the conversation to be according to her. She shouts to behind us to speak like her or speak what she is speaking which due to which both me and my sister doesn't like to converse infront of her.

Due to her controling behaviour and dysfunctional family dynamics, I tend to visited the school everyday on every working Saturday. People from india would know that 2 Saturdays in a school would be working Saturdays. I use to visit every day due to which people considered me weird and awkward making fun of me. The same behaviour continued to college till vivid struck. I used to leave home by 8 am even though my college starts at 10 am. I stayed till the official time of 5:30 pm sitting all alone in the classroom, as every other student leaves the college by 3pm and because I would be the only student left, no teacher use to come to the classroom.

This behaviour of mine of attending college everyday and staying till oficial time, has upset many students of my class that some of them even threatened me to leave early or else I will be beaten. They did so because I ruined plans of bunk and they are not wrong, me being in the class all alone doesn't lead to anything productive. It only leads to problem of attendence.


But I can't explain to them why I do it. I can't help myself. The only reason I went to school or college is to get some alone time away from the reality of my life. I never went to school or college for studying. That's why I never got the drive or ambition to score well or get a rank. Because this was never my agenda.

But then covid struck and everything went downhill. The online classes and my mother's laser eyed focus on me and my sister was the most mentally draining thing. Since we live in a single bedroom flat, the desktop is situated there only. My mother sits on the bed keeping focus on every interaction in online class. She keeps on proding to ask question, to answer question to let her talk to each teacher on our behalf because we are useless in communication according to her. Due to this I stopped taking online classes or took them with muted volume making an excuse that there is problem in teachers side. In short I don't want her to intrusion in this part of my life. Because of covid the two distinct realities alone time outside house in college and the toxic home reality collided leaving only the toxic part.


Now answering the question of getting angry at helpful redditors. The answer is if I act on the advice like getting fit, starting a diet, changing my hairstyle, joining gym, going for a walk, etc , it would be according to my mother's liking. She will decide the diet, she will decide the gym she will decide when and where should go to walk, she would decide the hairstyle she would decide each an every aspect of me and my sister's life because we are not as smart as other children, so it's her duty to decide each and every thing to the tiniest detail.


And I don't want that. I don't believe in my parents. Don't believe in any parent in my extended family, because most of them are toxic, dysfunctional, patriarchal, misogynistic or a combination of these. I got my mother's hunch of doing things my own way but this leads to clashes, in which I often gets slaps or kicks. Since my father doesn't earn and house runs on the money my mother collected by selling every belonging she also has the monetary control over these decisions.

My mother wants to control each an everything, because one time she gave the power of deciding upon one of the most important decision(her marriage), and it ruined her whole life. This is her way of having an elusion of control on the seemingly uncontrollable life of ours. She considers herself perfect and consider me, my sister and my father incapable of deciding good of our own. She doesn't like to be questioned, even she spoke something wrong. She doesn't like to be corrected, because she consider herself perfect, and it's because of her we are alive. If we were to live with my father without her we would have been long dead.

So, I hate advices and tips because I can't act on them on my own accord. I have to be a puppet of my mother, in order  to act on any of the advice. Because most of the decision of parents for their children in my family are horrific. I am suffering through this skin disease due to the courtsey of my mother who forced the 12 yr old me to drink a concoction of white pepper mixed in milk in order to correct my eye sight on advice of some wannabe alternative medicine enthusiast friend. Till she refrains from taking responsibility for my skin condition and instead blames my body, saying it's my horrible body which developed side effects and it's not her mistake.

So, the only way for me to change my circumstances is to kill myself, because if I were to continue living it will be on the whims and wishes of my mother and if doesn't want that I have to leave the house. Since I have nowhere else to go and have no commercial skill I would die like beggar or street dog. I don't want to die like that. So, I will kill myself before such a day arrives

I know this post won't be read by anyone due to it's long nature, but if anyone read it please don't provide any advice, because I can't act on it. Because i get paralyzed on thought of my mother dissecting my every act, my every thought and every independent impulse to shreds. I don't believe that working hard can change my life, because if that ought to be true my mother won't have go through all of that and become this mean and bitter creature. Please I beg you don't drop advice. Don't force me to remember again and again that my life is not my own, just because I committed the sin of being born. The only way to amend for this sin is death as early as possible by my own hands.",bropill,1611604743,KINGYOMA,0,1,True,2021-01-25

So my friend is unhappy. I'm kind of worried, but I don't know how to help.

To be clear, I've never met him in person. We met over discord playing Magic.

He used to be part of a toxic friend group I am still in. He eventually left, but it did a number on him. He felt really picked on, and it made him upset a lot.

He now has 1 main friend group and 1 other friend.

I think he is lonely, and maybe depressed, but I'm not a psychiatrist. He says he's felt this way for the last 6 years. He says he's tried therapy to no avail.

 I just woke up at midnight and feel like something is missing. Not to mention, I am a worthless piece of sheet and in the past, I had been suicidal and now thinking and not sure whether it'd better disappear or not. I am taking a look at my wrists unintentionally…. To break this foggy/disrupted mind I even consider hurting myself am I losing my mind? I have a decent job and paying the bills, but I don't know what sparkles ungratefulness in my mind, I hate myself in a way…  I am kinda but something vital is missing.

Honestly, I don't have any future dream, neither any effort to improve my life, without a goal my mind turns up and down like a pendulum. Haven't got any idea where I'm going or living for what…

All I require is to be understood by someone. To be protected and be guided by someone about life's journey. I live alone. Strangers are cruel when I pour (overshare) out myself to them. I don't even have a hobby now. How should I behave myself? How to manage this waste of garbage.

I was diagnosed with PTSD :(,"Title.

I was diagnosed with PTSD with depersonalization/derealization yesterday by my psychiatrist. They came to this conclusion because of my prolonged periods of depression, frequent anxiety, recurrent intrusive memories (flashbacks as one would call them), avoidance of certain people and places, sleeplessness, gaps in memory, self-harm (cutting), multiple instances of trauma and the aforementioned depersonalization/derealization. 

So yeah, I'm a label now :/

The worst part is that I have to keep it a secret from my parents because I know that if they found out I have this condition they would gaslight the fuck out of me and the things they did in the past. For Insurance reasons I have ""major depressive disorder and anxiety"" so we're covered and so that my PTSD isn't detailed to my parents since I'm a minor, sort of a wink-wink-nudge-nudge between me and my psychiatrist.

I feel tired and pathetic,"In late 2019 I decided too better myself (less wasting time on the internet, more reading, no porn etc.).
And most importantly tackling my mental health issues but covid has made everything worse. My mood has been going down hill since last June. I have a bunch of deadlines for university and exams for the next month but I am just so tired. Since November things have become even worse. I may have developed an allergy to a substance used in printing or something because every time I open a book I start having trouble breathing. Disconnecting from the world by reading and not looking at a screen in the evening kept me somewhat sane but now I can't even do that. 

I desperately need sustained human interaction. I need to see people every day not just an occasional socially distanced walk in the park. I feel super isolated and alone. 

I decided to stop watching porn because I felt like I had a problematic relationship with it but I have failed a lot, especially this month. The internet, however, doesn't offer much helpful content in that regard, it is all littered with religious infused pseudoscience. 

I am actually thinking of suicide (I am not actually considering suicide) but I just imagine killing myself. I have had this every now and then since I was a teenager, but not this frequently. 

Since I do not try to supress my feelings anymore I actually cry a lot more than usual. I cannot ""fully"" cry, however. I always feel like I am not done but can't go any further when crying (I hope that makes sense). I also get headaches when I cry which is really unpleasant. 

I have also been experiencing random bouts of dizziness. I have been to numerous doctors but so far no idea what is causing it. Next stop is an ENT physician. I have not made an appointment though. They have been getting way less frequent thought which is awesome.

How can I forgive myself?,"**[TW: suicide / self-harm]**

I first self-harmed when I was 8 or 9. I just hit myself with a rock and it left a scar on my face, but it healed quickly. But when I was 11, I cut myself a few times. Then at age 12, I was cutting myself regularly until my upper arms were covered in scars. And finally, the same summer, I quit self-harming for good (though I messed up once a few months later). Why did I do it? It was a coping mechanism, simple as. I had to hurt myself to prevent myself from straight up killing myself. I guess it was... a way of easing the pain. I just transferred some of my internal pain to external sources. But I stopped, regardless.

I’m 15 and a 1/2 now. The scars aren’t as bright or red as they used to be. But they’re still very much visible. Every time I take a shower, every time I change clothes, I’m struck with regret for my past actions. I can’t stop wishing I could go back in time and stop myself from self-harming. I wish at least I did something that wasn’t permanent. I’m stuck with these ugly scars for life because... I was sad at age 12. I’m so angry that I could slap myself. When people sees them, they instantly learn about my past.

hey bros(rant),"tl:dr short version of my life story. need words of support and encouragement. reading whole thing not needed but i needed to let it all out so it'll be here i guess.

tw for abuse, rape, suicide, just kinda bad things in general. and sorry if things dont make sense or are worded poorly. im a native english speaker im just dumb.

a quick look through my posts and comments would teach you a few things about me: I have DID, I'm struggling with the loss of loved ones, and my parents aren't the greatest.

I've been abused sexually, physically, and mentally for most of my life by people I called friends. people only talked to me when they needed something and I would do it so they wouldn't hate me. I never knew I could say no. people would use me for school work(I've been in advanced classes my whole life), to take their anger/frustration out on(I've been knocked out, pissed on, thrown from high places, hit, cut, burned, I'm not even allowed to remember most of the shit that's happened to me, but that's where my liking of medical stuff appeared, and around the time my leg/knee problems first developed), frame me for the bad things they did. I still considered school my safe place, as it was better than my neighbourhood at the time. when I was 4 we had moved there, and I was raped for two years by an older man. it only stopped once he had died. a boy who lived nearby also would do things to me, but never sex or stuff like that. he was only a little older than me so I doubt it was anything more than him having a crush on me. there were also fires a lot and it was pretty dangerous. I think the only reason police weren't there constantly is because it was a white neighbourhood. I don't remember seeing anyone that wasn't white there. 

when we moved houses when I was in first grade, we didn't change schools, so my life continued to be the same, but I didn't mind it much, people were happy using me so I was fine with it. I don't care if they break me beyond repair as long as they're happy. in second grade I met the first person I would call an abuser(A). she used me, stole my stuff, used my innocence and blind trust in others to try and get me to do bad things(like stealing or hurting people) but I was still set on going down the ""good"" path. I never got to choose what we would do when she was around, and she cut me away from all my other(not the best but better than everyone else) friends. my life was like that until the next year when I was in third grade and I met my second abuser(B). she used me to do things for her, pretty much the same thing as the first one but she was a year older than me and forced the mindset of ""you have to do everything someone older than you asks of you"". A and B HATED each other and both were trying to manipulate me their way. it stopped only when A moved away and we lost all contact. 

in fourth grade we moved again, this time changing schools too. I kept contact with B though. my teacher told me to sit next to this girl(C) if she hadn't told me to then maybe I would be in a better spot now. C was my third, and worst, abuser. she eased me into it, as she didn't know I thought friendships were supposed to be abusive. C eventually started making me do things and I soon was known as the kid that will do anything you ask. some kid even brought a knife to school and tried to stab me because he knew I wouldn't resist(he got suspended for three days and he did not succeed in stabbing me). C then started ignoring me for weeks at a time whenever I acted out of line, only bothering to look at me to make sure I knew she was angry, and only speaking to threaten me or tell me to kill myself. I met some other friends(though I only am still in contact with two of them). I thought I was happy but sometimes the mask gets so hard to take off it begins to fool even yourself. she refused to help me when I needed it, never said sorry when she would ""accidentally"" hurt me or when she tripped me to cause me to make a scene. 

fifth grade was the same shit but worse. still carefully playing with me to make me a perfect doll. I ended up coming out as pan in the summer before sixth grade, and that's when her plan changed.

she manipulated me into falling in love with her so I would never leave her. she made another friend(who texted me last year saying C did similar things to her) and would make sure to ignore me for her just enough to make me jealous and hurt. she made fun of me for not developing breasts like the other girls and kept taunting me asking where my period was(which still hasn't started thankfully). C would still ignore me, harass me, tell me to die, speaking for and over me, rigging seating choices so I would always be with her. the only class I didn't have with her was band(where I had made a new friend that I am still in contact with), which she ended up joining in seventh grade. I was mostly ignored in middle school but because of how I was used to being treated, I thought it meant everyone hated me.

most of the seventh grade was the same, C made new friends and taunted me by pretending to leave me behind to join them. I ended up dating one of them for a bit in eighth grade but it wasn't a very healthy relationship, at least it was better than the one I had before that(boy threatened suicide if I broke up with him even though he didn't ask me out he just declared me his gf).

sorry for getting the order of things messed up but this happened when I was 11. I was groomed on amino into thinking paedophilia is okay and normal and was then threatened into sending nudes but I just deleted everything and ran. my groomers ended up finding my address and using it to threaten me earlier this year after finding my Twitter. I also met someone I loved dearly and we planned on getting married but he ended up killing himself. I don't want to go into detail of our relationship but it was good and he helped me in so many ways but I failed him and let him die. I was talking to him as he bled out and his final words were ""thank you for making my life better, you even manage to comfort me into death"". I hate myself for failing and being so stupid for not helping. I should have known what to do to stop the bleeding. but now I know lots more, and I'm not letting anyone else die. its been hard but several people have told me I saved their lives, either by helping them through illness, talking them out of suicide, or even just supporting them. I would guide people through helping their cuts, bruises, and sickness, as I couldn't be there in person.

back to seventh grade, I got sidetracked I'm sorry. my knee ended up finally giving out while running in gym, even though I had told my parents it was going to happen and requested them to let me have a few days off from gym. they didn't believe me though and even now, two years later, I can't run without my knee popping out of place. C got mad at me for this and the next three days were a living hell from her. we made up because I can't get mad at people.

eighth grade started, in around November I got Twitter and I decided to cut C off for good. I was taking five advanced classes and it was putting lots of stress on me. I also had begun questioning my gender. I got a girlfriend who then convinced me to go back to C and my stupid ass did. then quarantine happened and I took the chance to run from C for good.

March 2020 I met my best friend on Twitter and we've been inseparable since. I got adopted into an e-family and I got another girlfriend(mutually parted ways with ex). eventually, my gf and I broke up as neither of us were mentally well enough to have a healthy relationship. I got into Twitter drama somehow and I got accused of being a paedophile which was traumatic. I only had like 60 followers and the people accusing me and dragging me into drama had ten times that so I deactivated that account and hid on a new private account with only my closest friends. one of them got accused of being a paedophile (by a zoophile too) and that's when I discovered the community against paedophiles and just kinda slipped in. I was dealing with massive guilt over my previous mindset so I put everything into finding cp distributors and reporting them to police. I've gotten several people arrested. I went as far as to make a bait account to attract paedophiles and make a document on them. I could never release that doc however because my email got hacked and I lost access to it. all the stuff I saw was triggering me and since I had forgotten my trauma I thought I was just weak and forced myself to keep going. this caused me to have my first full breakdown where I completely shut down and an alter is forced to the front. I only know this because she had talked my then gf out of suicide and gave her name. gradually more alters began revealing themselves and now it's like I have a family inside my head. I like them much better than my real family. I pushed all that aside and continued doing my work, and eventually got myself addicted to alcohol(its been on and off struggle but I'm currently 6 weeks clean). I became a somewhat known and actually respected member of that community over the next few months and made a few amazing friends. I took in someone like my child and I thought I could trust her but I guess I couldn't. one of my friends got all of us into Danganronpa(kept comparing us to characters, calling me an irl Mikan Tsumiki constantly), so if anyone reading this knows the games, think of this person as an irl Tenko. basically, she's a hardcore misandrist which affected me negatively(C had forced it on to me that all men are bad and trans men are even worse because they choose to be a man, but I had shoved that deep inside me). it caused lots of problems. she said I was ""one of the good ones"" but the only ones she said were ""good"" were trans men which made me feel like she doesn't see me as enough of a man to be hated. I'm fine with jokes about hating men but for some reason, she hurt me. I feel awful about it still because I'm supposed to be a man and I'm supposed to be hated for it, right? this was a few weeks ago and in that time I've lost all progress I've made and am back to not being able to eat, sleep, and started hallucinating again.

just a few days ago I overheard my parents talking about the cameras they've put around the house. I wasn't supposed to hear it so I quietly went back upstairs and into my room, where I saw a small camera in my closet. I pretended to not see it. there's even one in the bathroom. I don't feel safe and I cant have an outside source help me because last time someone tried it made things worse. I used to go downstairs at night and hang out with the cats and maybe take a walk but I can't do that anymore. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. that's why I came here to just rant about my entire life. I'm sorry if you've read all of this because it was probably a waste of time. I just need some support I guess. again I'm sorry for making you read all of this, please have a wonderful life. ily guys",bropill,1611875671,leftist-femboy,0,1,True,2021-01-28

When coping doesn't work: Depressive bouts causing unhappiness and I want to know how to feel happy,"I've felt ok the past few weeks, but the bouts of depression always come back. The feelings of hopelessness. Feeling defeated. No friends. No girlfriend. Self pity. The feeling that I can't be happy alone anymore. 

""JUsT wORk On yOuRSeLF BRo""

I've had nearly a year of doing that, and barely actually worked on my self. I go to the gym and am in better shape than last january, but what else do I have to show for my life. I'm boring. I'm average looking. I have very little free time due to taking 18 credits this semester to try anything new. Sometimes I go for a hike because I have no friends. I want to try new things, but lose motivation quickly when trying them. I haven't interracted with anyone besides my brother or parents since before christmas when I was working.

The last time I truly felt happy was in May/June, before I found out I wouldn't be going back on campus this fall. Then I found I wouldn't be going on campus this spring. Then I found out I will probably spend my 22nd birthday alone in my bedroom crying in a few weeks, realizing all the things I hate about myself. When I'm sad and depressed, all my worries in the back of my mind come in full force:

I'll be turing 22 and still a virgin who never had a girlfriend. I have ZERO social circles or friends due to being introverted and bullied as a teenager. I haven't seen my few college friends in over a year thanks to covid. I never experienced a lot of the friendship milestones most people had by my age. I honestly feel like I might be slightly autistic (my brother is). I have always felt like I never fit in. I will probably never have the confidence or feeling of self worth to get a girlfriend, and I'm too boring for any of them to stay. I will never know what it's like to date/experience love as a teeanger or college kid with no responsibilites. Those years are gone. I also have bad body dismorphia due to years of being bullied as a fat teen, as well as browsing incel reddits and realizing all my physical flaws. I also worry about my future. I have 90k in student loans and I still have 1 year left, and somehow need to come up with ~20k for this fall. I'm a stupid kid who chose to go to an out of state college. And finding any kind of internship is a lost cause. I had a terrible day in the stock market that really tanked my mood today, and now I'm $1000 short for my tuition payment plan due in march. I likely won't own a house in this economy. I might never have a family due to expenses.

I know at some point my depressive bout will pass as it has before, but these are so much more common now for me. I have major fears of long-lasting negitive effects on my mental health from this isolation and self hate. I just need someone to tell me it gets better, and that I will have things to look foreward to in the future.",bropill,1611891948,No-Situation849,3,1,True,2021-01-28

"[Rant]: I am super angry, frustrated, and disappointed. Feel powerless and hopeless","For the past few days, seeing the shitshow our world is and how a select few are ruining our lives, my blood has literally been boiling. I am super angry, annoyed, and frustrated because I am powerless. 

First of all, I am an Indian living in Canada and there is a bullshit government back home. They are making farmers' lives miserable and then calling them terrorists for protesting it. The worst thing is, people whom I went to school with (I am just 21!!!), are supporting the government. It frustrates me to the core. The cops misuse their power, yet Indian films **glamorize** police brutality. Several High Courts of India ruled out sexual misconduct cases because of ""no skin touch"". I have zero hopes for India anymore. There is a reason I came to Canada for education, but still, it is my motherland, and seeing it taken over by a religious extremist government over the past 7 years is extremely angering. And people support that stupid government. Police have made something called ""Love Jihad"" Laws which give police the right to arrest Hindu-Muslim marriages because the government somehow feels women have zero agency and are manipulated by ""devious"" Muslim men to convert them. There were instances of police brutality on students for the past 5 years under this government. Kashmir has been military-occupied, the Indian military constantly harms the people there. And still, the army is **glamorized.** 

And there is Alberta. They slashed the education and healthcare funding and constantly trying to privatize healthcare. It is a right-wing government, so you know, typical stuff. I get very frustrated. And the university does not make it any easier. Some professors increased workloads where 3 credit courses are taking more than 9 hours a week, many profs who are actually trying to help are facing burnout because of changing environment, and the Student Unions does nothing. 

Leaving that, every fucking authority in the world is arrogant and abusing their power. Rich gained $3.9 **trillion** while the poor lost exactly the same amount. WHY? Police are killing people without reason in any damn country, the governments are misusing their powers to pass laws stripping off women's autonomy, minority rights, and privatizing basic human necessities.  

I AM ANGRY. I AM DISAPPOINTED. I AM FRUSTRATED. I AM POWERLESS AND HOPELESS. I AM HAVING UNBEARABLE LEVEL OF DISSATISFACTION WITH LIFE. The fact that I will graduate in a couple of years and then have to labour my life to some greedy corporate asshole. I have given up hope on finding someone because even that is a commodity nowadays. They have put a price on love, on tears, and on each emotion humans have. We were evolved to be helping each other out and few greedy individuals have ruined the entire world and I can do nothing but hope that they suffer their consequences. Seriously, I have no hope, no dreams, nothing. The world is fucked up and I would be better off dead because people never have enough time to care about others and it is practically impossible in this stupid capitalistic world created by greedy individuals. 

I go to therapy and it worked a lot on personal stuff. But I don't know. Sometimes I wish I was like MLK or another hero who brought people together to fight injustice. But once I look into a mirror, it pulls me to the ground because I do not have such a caliber. I am a below-average to an average looking guy with probably average intelligence (I want to think I am intelligent, but my GPA says no to that), who can't even get his friends to think about this stuff.  If I can't even make my friends or family care about this stuff, what good will I be convincing people? It is all looking dark to me, despite trying to look at the bright side because every-fucking-thing is commodified in this world, everything has a price put to it, and I hate the world. I am tired and just want to be left alone. I want to run away. 

Feeling all this definitely makes physical changes and I am afraid of that as well. What if my body has too much cortisol? I haven't felt a little bit of oxytocin in two years because that is when I last hugged someone (mom and dad). I have no idea how coming years are going to be like. Or whether they are going to be there at all. Because there is zero hope in this world. In Captain Holt's words: EVERYTHING IS GARBAGE. Or in Rosa Diaz words: I HATE PEOPLE. LIFE SUCKS. NOTHING GOOD EVER HAPPENS. 

I am sorry for all the frustration. I had so much pent up anger, if I really have to put them in words, it is going to be a book. So I'll stop here.",bropill,1611959519,sayinedi,38,1,True,2021-01-29
My bro victim blamed and gaslighted me when I opened up to him about being raped last year.,"It was super hard to tell him. He knew something was up with me for a while, and I finally told him last night.

""We all have our demons man. I was molested when I was a little kid I think, so that's really not an excuse to be acting the way you are. Keeping yourself locked in your room all the time isn't good for you and if you were raped you should know that.""

We had been fighting about a lie he told to get out of hanging out with me a week ago. I called him out on it, and he acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. Then when I reminded him he said ""that's what you're mad about? I can't be your friend if I'm always worried that any little thing will piss you off. I didn't tell you the truth because I didn't want to hurt your feelings, that's all. Don't take it so seriously.""

Then I told him that lying about it hurt me more than telling me the truth would have, and he said ""Sounds like you're blowing this out of proportion. I really have to take a break and evaluate whether or not you're worth it.""

Struggling with homework? Just do the first half, 50% is better that 0%. Struggling to do the dishes because the process of rinsing, prewashing, loading properly, then unloading feels overwhelming? Just throw it in there and run it 4 times.

Don't be annoyed about theoretical winnings you didn't made,"Trigger warning: This post is about stocks, especially GME. If you're tired about the topic just go on.

I've encountered many friends, offline and online who are sad not have invested on time and they tell me about what they could have won, all their theoretical profits they didn't got.

Many of them dreamed of reducing their work time or being able to go on big vacation with their SO. And I also found myself trapped in those thoughts.

**Theoretical wins don't count. Theoretical losses don't count.**

There will always be missed opportunities, most of them you will never even have heard of. Most people here are to young to remember '08 or the dotcom bubble, crazy markets are normal and in retrospective you'll always able to explain it (at least to let yourself believe you understood it).

Trying to change the internal dialogue,"Sometimes when I gather the courage to be open about shit like my traumas on social media, I don’t get any reaction from my friends. I was kinda upset about it for a minute, but then I thought about it.

1. There are lots of reasons people don’t say anything sometimes. They may not know what to say, or what type of commentary/response may be welcome, and although they care, they don’t know how to show it. Or perhaps they’re going through their own issues, and just don’t have the time/energy to engage.

2. If I really need a response, maybe that’s a sign i should start looking for professional help, where it’s certain and the ideas are well vetted by science TM. If I just want a response, that’s okay too, but I can’t demand one from people who have their own lives and shit to deal with. (Although if your friends habitually ignore you, get better friends).

3. I know seeing people being open about their issues has helped me, even when I haven’t said anything. Seeing my friends talk positively or negatively about their issues reminds me that it’s okay to make space for your feelings. Seeing them accept their bodies on social media reminds me it’s healthy to break those cishet patriarcal colonizer social idea we get force fed from birth. Maybe I’m doing the same for someone else.

Or yknow, maybe I am annoying, aren’t a good enough friend to others to deserve a response, or just am ugly and bad and no one wants to interrupt my awakening to this fact, or any of the other things my psyche tells me.

A little word of encouragement from someone that used be afraid of social interaction,"I was someone that had 0 friend in elementary school, then 6 friend in the middle school, then a lot more in high school, and now almost everyone in my faculty know me.

I spent my childhood gaming in front of computer, and watching VCDs about space and stuff. I don’t know how my family could afford them tbh, my family were dirt poor. I learnt how to make a flash animation and flash game since grade 4. Obviously, no one understand anything that I said (except my parents) because of my hobbies, and no kids wanted to be my friend. I had no social interaction outside of my family. I’m afraid to meet new people, and I’m uncomfortable in large public space (sometimes it feels like anxiety or something, my parent didn’t diagnose me, they had no money)

In middle school I made some progress. I happen to found a group of friend that play DOTA, and I were invited to play in their team. We did good, we won some LAN tournament and stuff. And eventually I learned how to do social interaction.

It took me a long time to have a close friend that I can have a deep conversation with. It took me a long time to have a courage to say “I like you” to my crush. It cost me a lot of cringy memories, and even some unnecessary fights. But that’s okay, that’s part of my learning proccess.

I used to think that social interaction is waste of time, that human mind sucks because it isn’t straightforward like a computer. So many non-linearity, so many confounding variable. Now I know, that’s the thing that made us all beautiful and unique. Each individual has so much backstory and lore to them, they all have different upbringing, different views, different aspiration and different preferences. And that’s okay. Peoples are like chaotic oscillation, unpredictable yet deterministic, and boy how beautiful is that?

"Hey bros, feeling extremely anxious right now, just need to write about it","goddamn man, my studies are putting so much pressure on me, i've never been so stressed and anxious in my entire life, last time i felt this nauseous from the amount of stress was in middle school and I really don't like what I'm feeling rn... It's been so bloody stressful, and every time I find myself thinking ""damn, this really is not healthy man"" i don't know what the hell to do, I barely have the time for anything, any spare time I have is spent either working or stressing about whatever it is that's stressful to me at the moment.

And to make things worse, there's a long term project which me and some friends need to do for our studies, and it ain't going well at all, so it's been stressing the shit out of me.

I’ve been codependent before. I can’t tell if I’m running into issues in my new relationship because of that or because she is not the right fit for me,"TLDR: I’ve been with someone for almost two months and whenever I try and share something with her she blankly stares. I have issues with codependency and I’m having a hard time figuring out if she has healthy boundaries and I’m learning what that looks like, or if she is actually kind of cold and not very good for me. I just need some bro advice on whether I should leave the relationship, or if I should stay. And if I should stay, what would it look like if it was healthy. 

I’m having problems in a relatively new relationship. 

I’ve previously been codependent and I’m having trouble recognising whether my current partner is actually extremely healthy and I’m expecting to much from her, or if she is actually kind of cold and is never going to be a person I feel happy to be with. 

My suspicion is that it’s a bit of both. I would really like some help figuring out what I should do. Right now I feel like we’re circling the drain and will probably break up. 

The last four years have been really hard for me. I kept getting injured and have had mental health problems. I gained 40kg and my mental health really slipped. I got diagnosed with ADHD and the meds have helped a lot. I’m working with a psychologist about binge eating behaviour and my relationship with food more broadly. I am trying, but I’m definitely not in a highly healthy place yet. I’m fully aware of that. I’m embarrassed about it, but I am trying to fix it. I’m on the upswing.

We’ve been dating for just south of two months. We’ve probably had three arguments in that time - much more than I’ve had in any previous relationship.

It’s been a tumultuous eight weeks. She got a promotion, her brother was badly hurt, I hurt my leg and had to take 10 days off work and started working with a therapist about my binge eating behaviour. I also started a new sport and we both have been trialing new medication (the pill for her, testosterone replacement therapy (for low T) for me). We spend about three nights a week together.

I feel like we communicate in different ways. I can’t tell if I have unfair expectations of her or if she’s just so different to other women I’ve been with that I’m having a hard time because I have actually been in codependent relationships previously.

We’re running into some real issues with communication. She gets overwhelmed really easily when I try and share what’s going on in my life. She blankly stares at me and it makes me feel really uncomfortable. I sometimes wonder if she has mild autism. I’m almost positive that she has ADHD. 

It’s not that she stares that makes me uncomfortable, it’s that she says nothing. I’ll open up to her about my feelings and feel more alone for having shared with her.

Yesterday we had a fight.

I texted her about something I was uncomfortable with. I fucked up my timing here - I should have waited until after work to talk about it. I said to her that sometimes when I tried to open up to her about something, I felt more alone for having spoken because she just doesn’t reply and stares at me like i’m a leper. 

She told me that my feeling vulnerable was not her responsibility. I agree with her in principle, but the flip side to that is I don’t want to be with someone who makes me feel more alone for having spoken. I don’t feel this kind of vulnerability when I talk to my closest friends or a family member. 

Now there’s a kernel of something healthy there: she is not trying to take responsibility for my emotions. That’s a really good thing, and something I’ve realised I was expecting her to do. I’m trying to work on that, but it’s a steep learning curve and I’m not doing a very good job at the moment. 

Is it wrong of me to say “actually no, if I feel more vulnerable for having spoken with you then it is something you need to work on, or otherwise I won’t be able to ever feel secure with you?”

I feel I can reasonably take issue with how she responds to my sharing something personal. I often feel more alone for having spoken and I don’t think that’s sustainable for me. 

My issues are my own, but if I’m going to be with her I need to feel content speaking freely with and who doesn’t stare at me like I’m a leper when I open up to her (this is where I feel like she may be autistic). 

As well, she shares a lot about her friends private lives and it makes me think that I can’t trust her with my private life. 

She has some other red flags too: everyone she has dared previously has “been a dick” and she used to be a part of a very cliquey and narcissistic hippie group. This is a flag to me because it is always *their* fault.

I don’t feel secure when I speak with her. I feel like she’s waiting for me to stop talking and to just move on to something more lighthearted because that’s just what she wants out of life: silliness. I’m down for a laugh, but not all the time. Not when I’m trying to talk to my partner about an issue I’m having and get some encouragement or gentle support. Or just anything other than a blank stare. 

Maybe what I need isn’t what she can give. Maybe what I’m asking for isn’t healthy. Frankly I’m not sure I have a good idea of what healthy communication is after realising how co dependent my ex and I were. 

I listen to her, and I expect the same. I don’t make hidden contracts, I tell her directly “this thing here isn’t working, can we please work on this?”. When I am kind I do it because I want to be. If she asks me if an outfit looks good, I am honest with her about whether or not it does. And I expect the same from her (and have told her this explicitly)

When her brother had to go to the hospital, I was there for her. I asked her what she needed and made sure she got it (an initial vent, followed by time for herself). 

When she got a promotion at work, I brought her a little set of earrings because I wanted to celebrate with her. When I got a high distinction at uni for a subject, I got a single text acknowledging it...and it just felt so lacklustre. She’s been encouraging about me trying out a new sport, but again it’s just one or two sentences. There’s very little enthusiasm and I just feel like she doesn’t really give that much of a shit.

This is also relatively minor, but she never looks at any memes I send her. And the ones she sends me are funny maybe 20% of the time, but I do acknowledge that she sent them regardless. 

When I’ve asked for what I wanted I’m left feeling like I’m being unreasonable. 

Often when there is a conflict she makes it about her. 

Something she did caused me to have a panic attack. Her initial response was to keep walking and try and ignore me but I called her out on it. Her response was “I didn’t want to make a bigger deal out of it than it already was”. 

While I get the logic, that doesn’t work for me. I told her as much. This led to her having a panic attack in anticipation that I would become angry with her (I didn’t). We ended up having a good chat about it. 

She asked me directly whether I thought our communication works. I told her I didn’t, and that it would either make or break us. She agreed with me. We both resolved to keep trying as we liked the other one and for the most part have had fun. 

While she doesn’t ignore me anymore, she still stares blankly at me and I end up feeling more alone for having spoken.

She’s told me about her past and how friends have used her...but I can’t shake the feeling that I don’t fully believe her. I have known people who have been assaulted and abused who I believed - both men and women. But something about the way she says it makes me not trust that it’s true. I fully recognise that trauma presents differently, but I can’t shake this feeling. 

I hurt my leg and couldn’t work for 10 days. We hung out during it and I was a bit stressed about money. I’d ordered groceries to try and plan ahead, but the delivery came at the wrong time and all the food spoiled. It left me really, really stressed. I ended up nearly in tears because of how stressed I was. To her credit, she gave me a hug and just let me sob. 

But i just wanted to talk about what was going on without feeling like I was doing something wrong for talking. I don’t expect a fix from her - at least not consciously. I just want to know she’s got my back. Maybe her way of trying to show that doesn’t line up with what I need. 

During the time of work there was a few day patch where I didn’t clean my house. I warned her in advance that I hadn’t and apologised, explaining I just hadn’t had the desire to do it. 

A few days later after a different fight she confessed that she was worried about taking care of me and that my house had felt like a symbol of some deeper problem.

The thing is, I have ADHD and had depression. She doesn’t know what my house *used* to look like. She doesn’t know that I had cockroaches everywhere and that I used to not be able to see my floor. She doesn’t know how far I’ve come, all she saw is the one slip up. 

Now it’s not fair of me to expect her to know that, but it stung because this was the first slip up I’d had in a while. And it only took forty minutes of cleaning to get it back to normal. It made me feel insecure and judged. Like I was being lumped in with a former friend of hers who likely has borderline and took advantage of her for years. 

She went on to say that she didn’t like how I kept track of what I owed her (e.g. if she brought dinner, I’d ask what my share was so I could transfer it) and was concerned I’d be financially dependent. That didn’t feel fair: my effort to keep track of what I owed her, in my mind a responsible action, was being flipped and put to me as something that stressed her out. We reached a compromise and decided that going forward we’d just take it in turns to pay for things. That was fine by me. 

I’m greatful that she brought the issue up. It made me realise there were easy fixes to be had in my personal life that I had been treating as far more complicated than they actually were. I had been stressed about joining a particular gym for example, but decided to take a risk and try it out and ended up really liking the place. 

I apologised over text for bringing it up at the wrong time. That’s on me, I shouldn’t have been so impulsive. She had a rough day at work and apparently her auntie is having some kind of crisis so she doesn’t have the mental energy to deal with our argument. 

I asked if she wanted to talk about her auntie and she didn’t, saying she didn’t have the energy. That’s fair, I know from experience she needs alone time and I think that’s healthy. 

So I asked her then if we could talk this morning, trying to give her last night to recover. 

She asked me to just listen to what she was saying. Reading back I can see she was clearly asking to be left alone to process things and I totally missed that. I apologised and said I’d wait for her to reach out. I suspect I won’t here from her until this evening at least. Possibly longer. 

I recognise that I fucked up in my timing of this. What I’m struggling with is a battle between “am I being unreasonable” vs. “is she actually just not a good fit for me” 

I feel more exhausted for knowing her. I’ve definitley grown and seen some new things and gained some new perspective...but god damn am I exhausted.",bropill,1612312473,chuckitintheute,7,6,True,2021-02-02
A bit about my own mental health...,"Hey dudes. I’ve recently had some pretty significant breakthroughs in therapy, and in the interest of removing the stigma surrounding the mental health struggles of men, I thought I’d share my experience. Who knows, maybe it can help some dudes here.

So, the short of it is that I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since college (I’m 26 now), and I’ve had self esteem issues all my life. A big part of those self esteem issues has had to do with coming to terms with my own masculinity, and how to express that authentically in a society that really impresses on you that there’s only one “right” way to be a man. 

I’ll bet a lot of you guys can empathize here: we all grow up feeling like we need to be the tough guy, the warrior, the bachelor who views every woman as a sexual conquest, the stoic rock who supports everyone around them, the macho man, et cetera, et cetera, ad nauseam.

So, when you’re an emotional kid, chubby, not too good with girls, not athletic in the slightest, and into nerdy ass shit (where my Star Wars comic book fans at!?), it’s really fucking easy to feel out of place in society. Maybe you start trying to posture as somebody you’re not, trying to be the stoic tough guy that everyone who knows you knows you just aren’t. Maybe, like myself, this struggle with your own masculinity leads you down the path of reactionary politics, which is really goddamn hard to pull yourself out of once you’re in.

At the height of this, I honestly hated myself. I was a square peg trying to force myself into a round hole, and it was obvious to myself and everyone around me. But I’ll tell you what my dudes, working through these issues in therapy was such a breakthrough for me. 

My therapist helped me see that just because I didn’t fit into the traditional box of masculinity, that didn’t make me any less of a man. He helped me see that I was trying to be someone I’m not, rather than valuing the person I am. I came to see that I’m a very intelligent person who can articulate my ideas well. I am fiercely loyal to those I love. I am empathetic and nurturing. And you know what, I like myself. 

The most freeing thing you can do for yourself is to give yourself permission to express your masculinity *your* way. I promise you, you will feel that weight lift off your shoulders once you fully drive this point home for yourself. And if you feel like you can’t give yourself that validation, then shit, I’ll do it.

You have permission to be the kind of man that you feel inside. You are not less of a man just cause you don’t fit into this arbitrary box society places around us. Peace and love to you, kings.",bropill,1612317278,Jazz_the_Goose,3,10,True,2021-02-02
Trans man scared of being too old,"Hi bros 

I love this sub and I love the support we all give each other. 
This is my first time posting here though, just needed to get something off my chest. 

I'm a trans man - I'm 29, will be 30 in May. I only really figured myself out (and came to terms with it) half a year ago. So I'm not yet on T, and my top surgery date seems 100 years into the future. 

I love seeing younger trans people finding themselves and starting on T or E or blockers and feeling accomplished and whole. 
At the same time those posts hurt me the most - I see young people being themselves, and looking good and pretty and passing easier. 

And I'm just still.... female looking. I'll be thirty soon and I wanna look good. I wanna be the young handsome man I always wanted to be. Yet I feel like I'm so late... So late that I almost shouldn't bother. I just wanted to feel at home in my own body in my teens, in my twenties... Now that's too late. 

And it makes me so, so depressed. I want to be a cute boy, yet I'm almost 30. It makes me feel like I should be a grown man, and not cute. And that just makes me feel like there's 20 years of my life I didn't get to live at all - it feels like a huge chunk of my youth is missing. 

Sorry for the wall of text. 
I really am just looking for some light and positivity in all of this - what am I missing? I just want to see some light at the end of the tunnel. 


Thanks bros,

"""Men can't experience sexism""","Hello bros.  I was talking with three of my closest friends, two Cis women and another cis man. (I'm a cis man). We ended up discussing sexism, and after I said that I experience individual sexism due to my identity as a man, they all told me that although men could be discriminated against for their sex, they can't say men experience sexism because it doesn't come with the same ""baggage"" as sexism against women.

Obviously sexism against women is often worse and more rooted in patriarchy and tradition, it felt like an absolute gut punch that my friends refused to call what I experienced sexism, despite agreeing that it was the literal definition of sexism, and that they said that any harm incurred to men through our patriarchal society was a mere ""by-product"" of women's oppression and that it ""shouldnt be a priority"". 

I honestly feel really hurt, idk why but the fact that they refused to use the word sexism or treat the way men get harmed by the same system that harms women as serious really just fucked me up.

Need some advice on encouraging a bro,"In the last month I've made an acquaintance/friendship with a little bro here on Reddit. It started out because I posted a home made wholesome meme to encourage others. He ended up messaging and letting me know he was a kid in a dark place and it made him feel better. We started talking about life and I gave him space to open up about the difficulties he is having. He's a last year high school student going through all the awkward things teens go through: School, family, crushes, etc. I'm in my 30s and remember how bad hormones and crushed were, and parents not understanding me.

At the end of the conversation he said he was feeling better, and I encouraged him to reach out in case he needed to vent. He did eventually take me up on it and asked for girl and life advice. He talked about his insecurities with how awkward he is and I've given him as many pointers as I can. We also found out we have a lot of similar academic and career interests, so it was fun talking about that. Overall he is a cool dude, just young and inexperienced. I keep telling him that it may suck now but life gets better and to try to focus on school and friends who are positive influences.

Here is where the issue is: Our last conversation made my ears twitch. He started talking about how girls at school seem to only use him to help out with school work, and none of them have genuine interest in him. Through the past month I've tried to nudge him toward looking at girl as potential friends rather than someone he can eventually get in a relationship with. I don't think he is red pilled as he hasn't used any of their terminology, however I feel like he could easily go down that rabbit hole. He has a lot of really damaging ideas about women, (All they care about is penis size/looks/money etc) and I've encouraged him to check out r/askwomen, because they're asked about stuff like that a lot. He is also a POC and told me how insecure he is with dating in a mostly white country. 

I don't know what else to do. I don't want him going down the incel/PUA rabbit hole, but I'm also trying to make sure I respect some sort of boundary since I don't actually know this kid irl. I want to be a bro and I'm thinking of sending him here. Does anyone have any advice, or experience being in his situation?",bropill,1612457256,cabalofendocrinology,2,6,True,2021-02-04

I'm proud of my immigrant heritage,"A lot of white people will complain that they aren't allowed to be proud of who they are. Black pride is fine, they say, why is white pride automatically bad? Gay pride is good, why is straight pride bad?

I don't struggle with those things because I realized I have something to be very proud of. Generations ago, a group of Germans emigrated to Russia as guest workers. They remained there for so long that they developed a unique culture, even a unique dialect if the German language. They became known as Volga Germans. 

Over time, the political climate changed and many Volga Germans emigrated to America. Those who stayed behind were persecuted horribly, especially during Stalin's reign since he suspected them of being secretly loyal to Nazi Germany. 

I won't give you a whole history lesson, but I'm lucky enough at least to know the story of my family and their journey to America. And I'm proud of my ancestors for enduring hardship.

Although I benefit from the privilege of no longer being seen as an immigrant, that is my heritage, and I'm proud of it.

Many black Americans don't have that luxury. Their heritage has been hidden from them, forcing them to forge a new identity. And what black americans have created is rich, complex, and beautiful, especially considering the circumstances from which it arose. 

But I'm not proud to be white, because whiteness was invented to try and elevate me above my fellow human beings. It's an artificial conglomeration of ethnic groups which would never have previously been seen as the same (gauls, etruscans, latins, celts, slavs, etc)

I'm not ashamed to have fair skin or even to belong to the demographic category of white. I'm not really ashamed of much. I only regret the years I was unaware of the nature of whiteness and how I benefit from it. But I'm still proud to be me.",bropill,1610168786,WeaselSounds,4,1,True,2021-01-08

"About a writing ""project"" I had with one of my friends...","Back in July or August, me and one of my friends started writing ""The Bible 2"" as a joke. Just a piece of shit containing all our inside jokes and memes, fake history and we had a lot of fun writing the thing up until recently.

Today I wanted to show my friend the latest updates I've been working on and then he (who has seen every little thing we put into it and agreed to it) said it was cringe, then all of our other friends said everything they wanted to say about it, which was mostly negative feedback and that I should delete it.

I got really disappointed because every time I felt overwhelmed by life or I had a stupid 3 AM idea, I could just put it in and relax while writing all of that crap. It was never meant to hurt anyone and I would've just kept it for me, my friends group and everyone else that cared to see it. I never intended to hurt anyone, it was just a fun thing. I never wrote it to hate on the Bible or anyone who believes in anything, since the thing I was writing was just full of memes, jokes, made up stories and fake history.

Hung up on something I thought I'd cleared up,"Hey bros,

I have this issue that's been bothering me recently. Basically, my girlfriend (17) has a history with (not an actual relationship but did end up sleeping with him) an older guy (he was 20 and she was 16 at the time). I didn't feel very comfortable about this due to the age gap and because they were both drunk, so I talked to her about it and cleared it up. We've talked it through and, while it was legal and consensual, we've both acknowledged that it was still a very toxic situation and morally wrong. However, even though it's been like 2 months since we talked it through and it doesn't affect our relationship at all, I still find myself getting hung up on it occasionally. Like, I'd be going about my day, something would remind me of it and my thoughts would just trail off. 
I've thought about it some more and I think that while I have come to terms with it (past is in the past and whatever) it feels weird to have such a bad situation happen to someone so close to me. Another thing is that, though I don't like to admit it, since she's slept with someone so much more experienced and mature, I'm scared that I just can't be as good. Like, our sex has been great so far, but I just don't know if I'll ever be able to compare.
I'm hesitant to talk to her about it since I feel like I'm putting her in a position where she's basically forced to say that I'm doing well even if that's not necessarily true. Do you bros have any advice on what to do?

Been having some trouble,"Hey bros!

So, I've been having some trouble finishing when having sex. It takes a really long time, if I finish at all.

Let me first say: this is not a huge issue, sex can be awesome even without cumming. I think we all can use that reminder every once in a while. You don't **need** to come during sex. It's perfectly fine not to come, it doesn't make you less of a man, etc.

That said, I would like to resolve this issue. I'm not sure what has happened. Back story: me and my fiancee of 4 years split in august. It was mutual and a good split. Since then, I've dated a few girls, of which I've hooked up with three. The first one went fine. The second one, I couldn't finish the first time we slept together, but the second time went better. Now I've started dating the third one, and I really like her. The sex is honestly awesome. But I'm having huge trouble coming. We've had sex a bunch of times, but I've only finished once. Again; this is not a huge issue, because we both really enjoy it anyway, but I would like to be able to come faster/at all.

Do any of you have any experience with this? Could the cause be an increase in masturbation since my separation, that may have led to a kind of ""dulling"" of the senses? I've also had quite a bit of stress and anxiety recently (as well as covid), which I'm guessing can have an impact here.

Every bro is antifascist and no fascists (or their enablers) are bros.,"This is my favorite sub, always full of love and support, but I think this is worth repeating even here.

Fascism might be a new word or a familiar one you can’t quite define but have heard a lot of lately. Fascism is a right wing, authoritarian political and social ideology which has [14 general characteristics ](https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html) although not every characteristic is needed for something to be fascist.

Fascism is completely incompatible with being a bro. If you’re a bro, you’re antifascist, and there is no middle ground. I know that might sound harsh but it’s really not when you consider how clearly fascism divides values. You are either for or against scapegoating minorities for systemic issues, for or against authoritarianism, or human rights. This is the paradox of tolerance. If we strive for a society that treats everyone with respect, dignity, and freedom. we cannot also allow the promotion of genocidal, xenophobic bigotry and anti democratic ideals. Sometimes these ideas come in mobs trying to overthrow an election. Sometimes they come in the form of walls to keep migrants from “stealing your job” even though it’s the capitalist system that rewards exploiting refugee labor and the crisises the CIA causes in destabilizing Latin American countries that causes the issue. Fascism has many forms and [is on the rise around the world, due to growing inequality.](https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/news/fascism-rise-where-does-it-come-and-how-stop-it-common-european-response).

probably most helpfully, it’s really important to understand why people turn to fascism, so you can counter that narrative and keep friends from falling into it. Here’s a beautiful [explanation on why it occurs.](https://imgur.com/gallery/tGoFpwQ). If you don’t ready anything else read this one!

And finally, how to be an antifascist. Really so long as your not pro fascism you’re already antifascist. But to be a good antifascist and aid your community there are tons of actions you can take:

- learn about fascism + educate others
- donate to mutual aid groups esp those that are gonna be facing fascist protests like in DC
- protest, if you feel safe doing so. As we’ve seen on the 6th, fascists can turn violent very quickly, and law enforcement can’t be relied on, often aiding and participating in fascist movements. Join well established antifascist and other activist groups, and never go alone!

Dating as a male feels so complicated and wrong,"&gt;""It also doesn't work if you're the type of guy who has never been able to show interest to a woman. You're handicapping yourself if you are not even able to ask a girl out (me during my teens and twenties) because you've internalized that any showing of interest is potentially creepy. If you spend a large chunk of time reading overly online feminist blogs or forums full of socially anxious progressive inclined people, you might even get the impression that merely telling a woman that she's pretty is perpetuating the objectification of women and reducing women to their appearance."" - Some post on a male dating subreddit i think.

"Hey Bros, I could use some help.","My girlfriend has suffered with mental illness for years now, which was worsened when she moved in with me from a different state. Today she just left to go home and spend some time getting the help she needs and support from her family. She’s supposed to return in May for my graduation, however this is contingent on her recovery (of course there’s no “full recovery,” but our hope is that she’ll get better enough to move in again).

i33 met a girl23 on tinder in the summer - she lives ~80km away and we meet quite fast and had a really good time on our first ""date"". i meet her flatmates and we had some wine and sexytime. 
we saw us again the next weeks for more wine and sexytime and had a lot of fun and vibed really good.  she had an internship in my hometown so we saw us often and ate something and talked and had a good time .. blablabla

internship ended and lockdown + autumn came.. everything closed down and it was too cold outside to do anything fun. 

havent met her since then but always had contact in whatsapp and texted... texting got a bit slow after christmas.. but she mentioned i should visit her.. then radiosilence since last week.

i miss her and want her to know that i really think she is a very special and kind person .. but i dont want to pressure her or be clingy and creepy.  we never talked about relationships and anything.. and i dont think either of us wants to have one (but i dont know for sure).

while writing this wall of text i think i just should text her .. cause its no big deal... but it feels like im bothering and pressuring her with my feelings.

Can we dispel the myth that guys will just sleep with any woman on sight without thought or emotion?,"This is my biggest pet peeve and I've gotten it from both my male and female friends and it really does piss me off and it really is telling on how both sides perceive men.

I am attracted to women as a straight man which means I do get turned on looking at women of all shapes and sizes. I also get turned on by how they smell and how they sound and how their personality is...etc

we have all had that experience of meeting someone attractive until they opened their mouth or do something weird with their behavior.


That isn't just a girl thing though.

I hate it when my guy friends are openly cat hauling a girl and trying to get me to join in because I hate it and it's disrespectful and they don't even know if I even like the girl or not.

Just because a girl is attractive does not mean you are attracted to her and vice versa.

I have a female friend who I grew up with,she is very attractive and I can acknowledge that but thinking about the act of having sex with her throws me off just because I see her as a sister.

But the emotional aspect kind of hurts the most because I thought that was the point of dating in relationships and even sex.

Who wants to be an emotional zombie throughout the courtship process all the way down to getting our rocks off.

I'm still a virgin though so I don't know but I have fooled around a bit. But I think that's what stopped me from going all the way it's just because I don't think I can really do it, at leastuntil I know the girl but as a guy I feel like that's such a weird statement to make because we're stereotypically seen as horny ravenous dogs.

So many female friends have looked at me as if I am a unicorn because I've told them I didn't just want to hook up with whatever random girl and they act like I'm some type of one in a million guy. It's so insulting.

the one time I did get close to hooking up with someone was with my actual best friend who knew I had feelings for her but I chose not to pursue it. But she had a boyfriend and that they were on a break but that was a lie. I didn't want to be an asshole who was fucking someone else's girl.I've had that done to me so I called it off and I also didn't want her manipulating me just because she was going through something with her boyfriend.

But what drew me towards sleeping with her wasn't just the physical attraction but it was because I knew her for years already.

I don't know though I can't speak for all men but I hate that we're seeing instantly as having a one shot sexuality when no nuance.

Just last night my co-workers were making fun of some dude for buying a strap-on and I'm ashamed that I laughed with them but apparently it's not that uncommon for couples to buy different sets of toys and try them out.


But that interaction right there just told me that men and women seem to think men are just insert and thrust and grunt and then go back to the cave and brood. As a kid I really romanticize the eighties and nineties especially with the r&amp;b because it was still about love.

I think that is lost.",bropill,1610477490,defo18,70,3,True,2021-01-12
new year; new me,"hey bros

so it’s been a good 2021! At least for me. I wanted to vent/share some progress because like, I kind of just want to be heard and validated

I got kicked out of my house in early/mid November of 2020. Im [M20] so it was the first time that I’ve been on my own. But luckily I was already planning a move, scheduled for the end of November/beginning of December. I moved in with a friend for a month, and am now living with my sister, her husband, two dogs, and my baby nephew. It’s been a shitty situation all around. Im on weird/awkward terms with my mom and have gone almost completely no-contact with my dad, my anxiety disorder has gotten worse, and I developed some unhealthy attitudes toward work, money, life, etc. What sucks the most is that I cant see any of my friends due to COVID, and theyre basically like my found-family and not having much contact with them is killer. A pandemic was the worst time for all of this shit to happen.

However:

2021 has been a fresh start for me. I moved into my sisters place on Christmas day and by new years i got all my stuff put away, organized, etc. Having that sort of reset helped me. I’ve started working towards some goals I’ve wanted to do for a long time. I’ve been working out every single day of 2021 (shout out to /r/RingFitAdventure . The fact that I can see my character level up and gain new skills is the kind of instant gratification that makes someone like me able to not only stick to a work-out routine, but actually enjoy it. If you want to start working out, I highly recommend it, especially for you gamers). That was always something I wanted to do, as I’ve not been the biggest fan of my own body. Im not incredibly overweight, but Id like to lose 30-40 pounds. On day 10, I got myself a cheap fitbit (Inspire HR, on sale from Target dot com) to better track my calories. I’ve introduced an aggressive diet, trying to lose 2 pounds a week. It’s going pretty good, as I already don’t eat a lot anyway, just eating better food now and remaining aware of what it is I put into my body.

I still have a lot of goals. I want to become semi-fluent in Korean by 2022, I want to learn some guitar, I want to graduate by Spring of 2022 and keep my 4.0 GPA... Most of all, I want my plans with my best friend to come to fruition: she’s going to be my roommate. Eventually. She lost her job of 3 years due to covid last month so Im waiting for her to get a new one, but Im so excited for what this year has in store. Im going to have a body Im proud of by the summer, Im going to be living independently like I’ve wanted for a decade, Im going to be a better version of myself. There’s many obstacles in my way, but getting out of the abusive environment I was in has kickstarted my journey to being my best self.

The pyramid scheme I’m in has genuinely helped my life,"This may be a bit of a vent, so I apologize if this comes off as complainy.

But I’be been in a forex trading team for about two months. The team is through a thing called IM academy (aka iMarketsLive or IML). I had to pay $200 dollars to get in and I’m billed $175 a month unless I sign up two people. I’ve learned things about trading but I think I’ve lost about $150 from trading. I’ve made some profit off of trades and my mentors say that I’ve put in enough work to know that it works.

I didn’t know I lost as much as I did I looked on the app we use for trading and did the math to add everything up. Anyways, I noticed red flags in the very beginning of signing up since I voiced my skepticism of recruiting people. My mentor says that it’s ok to not recruit if I didn’t want to. So I was always skeptical but I overall kept a positive attitude about it and kinda chose to be ignorant about all the skepticisms I had. 

After doing research about IML I found that it’s really quite sketchy. I found that it isn’t necessary IM academy to be good at trading anything. You don’t need to be a part of a company to trade forex or Learn about financing or anything like that. It has a message that it’ll make you financially independent when really it just benefits the people on top. 

Here’s the most disappointing part of all:
2020 was obviously a very hard year. For me I finished the music program at my community college with an injured hand leaving me unable to do music for two months. I moved back in with my parents in a new town where I knew nobody and I still felt and feel like I have absolutely zero control over my life. I felt like I had nothing to lose. I got a job and I reached out to my friends posting stuff about forex and I saved up to join the academy. This gave me something to live for. My mentors became some really good friends and I felt like I was a part of something big. It made me feel like I had a support group and a good community to be a part of. It gave me motivation to do good things for myself and develop myself. Now that I’ve realized that it’s more or less a sham my motivation has plummeted. I’m back to aimlessly going about my day not wanting to do anything. 

Honestly I’m still in the fence. The pro about this is my mentors aren’t just marketers who were paid to recruit, they actually know how to trade.

The issue is that It gives me motivation to do what I want and it gives me something to strive for.",bropill,1610481441,TC-Wheeler,0,1,True,2021-01-12
I don't think I can be positive again knowing that when I go out in the world I'm going to have to be this bigger person,"What I mean by that is when I was younger I kicked my depression by letting things go especially things I knew were pointless.

in high school I kept getting made fun of and whether I did something socially right or wrong still ended up with me being outcasted so I told myself if I'm going to get made fun of by doing right or wrong I should just do what I want. And for a while it worked but I realized it also took me having to forgive people, especially in a social context where I knew I did nothing wrong and where I knew whatever they were trying to give me was stupid but I always held my tongue

But I feel like that's why I'm so angry now because why should I be this bigger person.

As a man I've always known how many men and women will treat me and for a while I was able to get over it and just be unapologetically me but as I get older it becomes harder because when you are open and vulnerable you leave yourself open for abuse.

So my friend and his partner seemed like they were pretty happy together but they were actually in a very toxic relationships. He was emotionally manipulating her for many months (she has severe depression and has battled suicidal thoughts) and due to him giving her gifts I guess that was his way of trying to fake apologize for what he did.

He indeed apologized for it but then he tried to convince me that what he did wasn’t true and I hated that my own friend was lying to me even though I knew what was going on. Obviously no one is perfect in a relationship and she may have started some arguments but manipulating someone overall is completely wrong and no one should go through this.

""It doesn't have to be like this, I won't be weird and ugly in the future, everyone keeps telling me it will be better so it has to"".

5 years ago I would have believed this, a year ago I also would have believed it. It's just that no matter what I do, switching schools, getting different medication or even going to a psych ward. This just doesn't seem to be the case nothing has gotten better over the years, I'm not finding any interests in school, I don't know how to talk to other people without them instantly thinking I'm weird, and it's also not like i can point to anything specific to fix, I do good in school, I'm healthy, my family is fine. The only thing I can point to is myself. I don't know what I'm supposed to tell myself If I ask myself to bomb my school, or kill this person or kill myself.

Self compassion?,"I used to use a fake profile on Grindr to talk to men and sext. I didn’t really realise at the time how awful this is, because I was more concerned with not being outed as gay to my parents. I have been so consumed with guilt for my past behaviour and worrying that someone has been really hurt by my actions. Even if no one has been hurt, I still feel really guilty because what I did was inherently wrong. 

I just feel really stuck in this loop of thinking about this behaviour, worrying about the people I talked to and hoping they’re okay, then worrying about my future and thinking what is the morally right thing to do (like apologising to those people or just moving on).

I have made many posts about this situation on this and other subreddits. People have told me that what happened was not okay, but that I need to be self-compassionate and forgive myself because I was figuring out my sexuality and dealing with homophobia. (For context: They’ve also suggested that my guilt is being blown out of proportion by my ocd/anxiety - I’m in therapy for this).

But how do you practice self compassion and forgive yourself when you don’t feel like you deserve it in the first place? I want to be able to help people and actually positively contribute to people’s lives but I don’t feel like I deserve that. I guess what I’m asking is - how do you grow and mature when you feel like an awful person?

"TL:DR of improving mental health: Exercise, mindfulness &amp; gratitude","Hey just a quick one:

I’ve helped 7 young men lower their depression and anxiety scores significantly.

Daily exercise, mindful meditation and gratitude journaling seem to be the 20% of actions that result in 80% of mental health improvement.

Exercise can be any form - I get my boys to do at least 10 pushups a day.

Meditation - The app I get everyone to use is called Medito on the App Store, by far the best non bs app I’ve ever used - I have done 357 sessions!

Gratitude journaling - Bullet point 1-5 things, people, events etc that you’re grateful for. This seems so simple and pointless until you feel its effect, then it gives you shivers and you try to convince everyone to get consistent in it.

Please use the comments below to do your daily gratitude journaling

1. I’m grateful for finding this subreddit

2. I’m grateful for experiencing pretty bad mental health last year as I have learnt from that and now help other guys with it.

3. I’m grateful for my diet with high fibre - currently having my 4th shit of the day lol

4. I’m grateful for my gymnastic rings workout session in the cold this morning",bropill,1610741253,Hamza97youtube,0,1,True,2021-01-15

"Date pressures me for sex, despite several stern ""no's"" from me"," I don't know if this is allowed here, but I need to vent. I recently met a girl, whom I have romantic interests in. We had been on one date prior to this and we hit it off pretty well. So yesterday, I picked her up from her work and she stayed the night at my place. Everything went well, but she was extremely pushy about having sex, despite me making it very clear I had no intention of having sex with her last night. So we're cuddling on my bed and she tells me she's going to the bathroom, cool whatever. She comes out in a very sexy night gown thing, and makes the remark ""changed your mind?"" to which I say ""nope"" So we cuddle some more, make out and such for about an hour. Then she does the same thing, but instead she comes out of my bathroom naked. This is after she asked me if I'd change my mind about sex if she got naked, which I replied no, again. She ends up convincing me to get some head from her, because she was basically begging for something sexual to happen. A few minutes of that and again she's trying to convince me to sleep with her, to which I replied no. I ended up fingering her though.

Am I tripping out? Part of me feels like she was being way too pushy despite my attempts to set a boundary, on the other hand, I feel like a fool for rejecting a beautiful woman who was basically throwing herself at me.",bropill,1610848186,coleserra,137,1,True,2021-01-16
Please tell me it's gonna be okay,"I'm feeling deppressed, self harming, and idealizing suicide again.

[Life-hack] Take yourself on a date!,"This post suggests a practice for self-love. You can ignore the intro if you're not interested in the background story. 

INTRO/CONTEXT

I am single, but it doesn't matter if you are or not.

I was just daydreaming about what my ultimate date would be....

I imagined a smokey bar where everyone dresses like people did in the 1920s. There's life music, jiving at first, then for dinner there's jazz, candlelight, romance... etc. Legit asking myself would someone make that happen for me? Ehh.. 

I had an epiphany.

THE DEAL

You are the only person that knows you best. You know what you enjoy, when, where, how, why. In what order, duration, repetition - etc.

Why ** would you wait for someone to make you happy? For someone to tick all your boxes? You have the power to do just that. 

So: I'm gonna make myself a candlelight dinner with smooth jazz music, make my favourite risotto, followed by a salted caramel and chocolate dessert. I just can't [redacted] wait! There might even be some slow-dancing with a pillow if I feel like it, ngl. Simply plotting this is already giving me so much joy..

Dear bros, I hope this inspires someone to just enjoy life, really. What's your perfect date? 

Sending you love and light! ❤️",bropill,1610851599,Atomicityy,8,1,True,2021-01-16
FtM internalised sexism: Different standards toward women and men.,"I'm trying to unlearn something here.

I grew up being told that girls are physically weaker, naturally worse at spatial recognition/ math and engineering than boys, bad with technology etc. Before I knew I was trans, I was the only ""girl"" among the top three mathletes in class. Spatial recognition and logic was the highest score in my IQ tests as a kid. And because I was taller than most children my age (before puberty hit), I was athletic too.

Because of this I felt I was the only ""girl"" trying to go against the unfair stereotype of females, and developed a spite towards girls that showed those ""feminine shortcomings"". And it was a stark double standard. If a boy was better at literature and art than math and sports, it was ok. Charming even. If a girl was the same way, it was feeding the stereotype. I felt anger at them.

Even more so towards myself. Driven with dysphoria before I even knew what it was, and the anger against the sterotype, whenever I fell short or felt like I ""lost against the boys"", I abused myself both verablly and physically. The pressure to be smarter and stronger when viewed as a female hits in a different way than when I'm viewed as a male. When I'm viewed as a male, it's because I'm expected to be, when I'm viewed as female, it's because I'm expected to be the opposite. And I have a primal loathing against stereotypes and cliches. That paired with all the impotent perfectionism of the ""former gifted child"", it destroyed my academic and social life when I graduated girls highschool and went to university where ""the men"" were.

Even now, professors encourage me to use my fluency in English to find a career in IT Translation because it's ""a good job for a woman"" (I'm not out or on hrt in uni). They wouldn't have said that if they saw me as a man. And when I see that so many trans women are better at tech than cis girls or trans guys, it feeds the biological stereotype idea even though I recognise that it's a good indication that proficiency at technology and such is mostly related to how we were socialised.

I love tech and games but I never touched a computer before deciding to major in computer engineering in uni because I was always told that computers were bad and was encouraged to read a book instead. So I did while all my male cousins were gathered around the pc playing starcraft. It's probably the same for a lot of afabs, regardless of their gender.

So intellectually, I know it's most likely a self fulfilling stereotype, but I still find myself being angrier at a girl for being bad at stuff like gaming than at a guy. And whatever horrid and untrue words I try to keep locked away at those times, they're a thousand times worse when directed at myself.

"Anyone have a longtime best friend who is always negative? What do? How to friend-breakup when they're you're closest friend &amp; you don't really have any other close friends?/(also an intro post/first post here I guess, hi hello)","This is my first post here. I've browsed a little, so hopefully I'm not breaking any rules or anything with my post. Feel free to delete or lock if so. Also hoping trans masc folks are welcome here, am ftm/ftx, hi lol. 

So I'm about to turn 31, and my best friend and I have been best friends since we were 11, so we've been best friends for about 20 years. Long story short, I used to have a good friend group of several people I was close with in high school and in my first attempt at college right after high school, but we all haven't really talked in about 10 years or more. This best friend is my oldest and closest friend. I have another best friend from that first attempt at college I still talk with, but we've never really talked as often as my best friend and I have. And recently I am making some more new friends, and getting closer to another friend I have known for about 3 years. But I am not anywhere as close with them as I am my best friend, and have not known any of them as long as I have my best friend. (Some of these new friends are people I've only met last week in one of my classes, but a bunch of us queer folks from a class wound up making our own group chat on insta and becoming friendly with each other and I'm enjoying it so far...but they're like a little over 10 years younger than me lol like they are 17-19 and I'm 31 in a month, so it also feels very weird and a little like I shouldn't share much personal stuff with them or something). 

Anyway... I'm a very positive and hopeful person, and those are the types of other people I want to surround myself with. My other friends, both the few older ones I talk to, and the newer ones I've made in the past week, are all also positive people. We are still able to complain and vent to each other, and express it when we are feeling something negative, but we also talk about positive things too, and we also express being hopeful about various things as well. But with my best friend...her first instinct is to see everything in a negative light. She takes everything personally. She thinks she's always right, so if someone says something different or offers a counter thought or opinion she takes it as a personal attack and it makes her angry and negative. She is getting her phd to practice psychiatry, and in her school programs has already been giving therapy in some internships and such, and both my parents who know her and another friend I have told about her to all don't understand how on earth she can give therapy well when she is always so negative and angry about every single thing ever. I don't know what she's like as a therapist, but she hasn't felt a need to give up on it, so there must be some things about it she's good at I guess. She is also in therapy herself, I think mostly for depression, but I really really hope she is working on her negativity issues there as well. At one point in time we were actually going to the same therapist when we lived in the same town, and it took everything in me to not plead a case to the therapist to like stage an intervention for my friend and tell her that people who love her are scared about how negative she's being...I felt that would be 1. some kind of breach between therapist and patients, and 2. my friend would 100% have known it was me who said anything, and my friend takes everything personally and is so sensitive and she gets so angry when she takes things personally, and I really don't want to be the cause of that, or feel her potential wrath lol (I don't thinks he would be violent or vengeful to me or anyone really, but even so I still would prefer not to even simply get told off by her or anything). So I wound up never saying anything. 

I would love to be able to have an open conversation with this friend about her negativity, but I know she would just take it personally, especially coming from her best friend, and it would make her feel even more depressed and even more negative. My second closest friend (from first attempt at college) has a best friend who is quite similar. Oddly they are both the Taurus astrology sign lol, but I don't think it's matters really, just kinda funny coincidence. This friend and I talk about our best friends a lot, and how negative they act. She said she was deliberately distancing herself from her friend and suggested I do the same with my friend. My best friend is the one I send everything to, memes, interesting instagram posts, stuff about the few shows etc we both still share an interest in (at this point tbh we really don't have much in common with what we like when it comes to media), and there isn't really anyone else I feel able to send all that stuff to, so not chatting with my best friend for long periods of time is hard. However I also know it is what I need to do. However, up until recently I just really didn't have any other friends I felt I could be as open with or potentially as close with. And currently my best friend is so busy with school that I will send her one or more texts most days, and she just won't reply for several days. So it feels like the perfect opportunity to try and put some distance between us. Now that I have other friends I feel I can share some of those things with maybe, I feel less of a need to text her daily, and she is not texting me often now anyway, so I plan to not text her back right away and try and leave a few days between when she texts me and when I reply. I am really hopeful that she will change and become more positive once she is done with school, but I also feel like this is maybe just kind of who she is now, and she will continue to be this way forever. 

I would love to feel able to just cut her off, and also to tell her why, and to tell her how bothersome her negativity is, and how I really just can't even stomach it, like my own mental health can not stomach it, and for the sake of my well being I feel a need to keep as positive of vibes as I can around me, and she is the opposite of a positive vibe. But I feel this would ruin our friendship (I'm fine with it ending, but I would rather it be that we just fall out of touch, rather than it end because of a fight or because of her feeling I'm personally attacking her), or worse yet send her into a worse depression spiral than she seems to already be in on a regular basis (she is in therapy and on medication now, but she has been suicidal in the past, and has said without those things it is something she thinks about every day...while she has never been manipulative with it and never said anything like ""if you're mean to me/stop being my friend, then I'll do xyz to myself"", but I still worry that losing a friend and especially such a close long time friend basically laying out her negative personality traits for her, would send her to a really bad place, and of course I don't want to do that...I still love her, I just don't think I can keep her sort of attitude around me for the sake of my own mental health and for the sake of my own mood). 

Anyway...anyone else ever been in a similar situation? Were you able to friend-breakup with them? If so how? Is there a way to do it without making it known to them that you can't stand their biggest personality trait lol? Or is there a way to ""ghost"" someone when you are so close with them and have been for so so long? I plan to continue to try and distance myself from her, but beyond that I really don't know what I can do that won't also hurt her feelings extremely badly.

But then he said he wanted to be alone and I couldn’t really do much sense he wasn’t responding to calls or facetimes because he didn’t want to be in one so I gave him like 15 minutes and I went and did something and when I came back and texted him he asked me why is it so hard and I assumed he was talking about life so I tried saying it gets better but then he said he was talking about killing himself and said he was hanging for 10 minutes and I just didn’t know what to say I just kinda kept telling him how much I care about him and that he shouldn’t do it at least for me. Some background I’ve liked him for a while now and I’ve told him but he is straight and not into me so yeah I kept telling him how I feel and ended up saying I loved him which is hard for me because I can barely say that to family. I just kept talking to him for hours and did until he fell asleep but I stayed awake all night to make sure if he woke up he could text me and I also had a covid test in the morning because I know I have covid I just needed the positive result for my work.

I wouldn’t be afraid to go to work or talk to people or have to be a full human. It would all just stop. Sometimes I think the same way about dying but I know I don’t want to die. Not in that insane need to escape the pain way I used to. But I don’t see a way out. And I don’t enjoy anything. On the weekends, when I don’t have to work I just, I try to sleep, or I do nothing.

Financial advices for investment from bro to bro,"Hey bros, as the title says I need finacial tipps for investments and insurance. I don't even know how to start but I guess I start with my situation and me. I am 29 years old and work as a craftsman in germany and make ~1.650€ each month (after taxes and social insurance). I don't have any extra inaurances only the state insurance by law (which include healthcare, pension, unemployment, care and accidents (only at work)). Although the german social insurance system is okayish I know that they are not enough if real shit happens. Especially the pension, unemployment and accident insirurance will not be enough if shit goes downhill. I was able to  save ~18.000€ over the past two years and I have no clue what to do with money. I hate money, hate the system behind it but I know I need it for a decent living and at some point I have to face reality. And in reality money loses value if it's just there and does nothing. The interest rate at a normal savings bank is very low (0,02%) which is obviously bullshit when you know that the european central bank has a inflation rate of ~2%. 
I am planing to achive my master craftsman in the next few years (maybe 2022) and I need ~10.000€ for that. I am in contact with the ""Deutsche Vermögensberatung"" (german investment counceling) which is the biggest Investment counceling in germany and we work on a personal concept for me which includes extra insurences like pension, accidents (at home and in free time), incapabilty to work and liability insurence and investment concepts for funds. 

I am aware that this is very specific for germany but we have an internationally connected finace system and I think similar concepts are available in many countries. 
I am not even able to formulate specific questions about this topic because I have no clue about anything that has to do with Investment and insurences. I just don't want to get screwed over by the grey man and want to live a decent life so any advice, input and opinions are welcome here. I hope that some bro has a clue about these things and can give me valid and honest input.

Some specific questions I can formulate:
Is it okay to work with investment councelings or should I make my own stuff?
How do I learn to make my own investments?
What are your investments?
What about Gold or crypto currencys? What about the stock market? How do I trade on it by my own if I would want to?

the fact that one of my best friends is in a relationship with my ex's best friend makes it difficult for me to hang out with him.,"It happened actually around the time we broke up. We also introduced them to each other and while I am happy that he found a healthy and good relationship (because he really wished for one), I can't help but feel like I shot myself in the foot with it.

I am a rather sensitive guy and the fact that his girlfriend is my ex's best friend just always creates anxiety when I hang out with him. It wasn't a bad breakup, but I am no contact with my ex, because I don't think I could heal otherwise. While I am okay with the fact that it's over (breakup was several months ago), I know that I will feel a gut punch when I hear that she will be in a new relationship with someone else. My best friend will obviously immediately know this, also probably go on double dates with them and while he won't tell me things on purpose that would hurt me in any way, I cannot shake this anxiety when spending time with him. It's like I am just waiting to hear something that could hurt me. Honestly, even though he writes me here and there to just see what's up, I find myself just not innitiating contact with him that much anymore because of it.

I know that no one is at fault or anything and that this is an issue that I have with myself, but this constant anxiety is just so grating and utterly exhausting, I do not want to go on with this feeling.

Actually I even thought about just moving away, since I will have an opportunity through my work to do this next year.",bropill,1611073123,Avongrove,28,1,True,2021-01-19

I just need to spill this out,"I don't know how to write this, but i'll try

 I am a burden to everyone around me, and everyone hates me, for good reason.
 I'm fat and ugly, i've tried to be healthier, but it never worked.
 I never made my parents proud of me, after my younger sister was born they never gave me attention and they never really bothered about talking to me.
 Everyone pities me and they try to befriend me, and i try to be the best friend i can, and i fail over and over again, i'm just inconvenient to everyone and fuck every friendship i have.
 Nothing i do or participate in succeeds, i always fuck up everything and it all goes to shit, i'm bad at everything, i don't have a talent or anything, and everything i try always fails, no matter how many times i try.
 I don't know what to do anymore, i'm just an asshole, everyone would be happier if i never existed, but i'm too scared of death to let it end.
 I just ruin everything i touch and don't know if i have the time and strength to fix it.

Hair,"When I was younger, it was always a big part of my identity to have nice hair. Brush it everyday, grow it as tall as I can, never tie it and let it wave in the wind proudly. 

Then something happened. Somewhere in my early twenties I started to shun this part of my identity, I wanted to peel away this layer. I stopped brushing it, I would always tie it to a practical knot. When tacks would emerge thanks to not brushing it, I would just remove those tacks with cisours or brute force. I grew confident in this style. I felt ashamed of my earlier days, where I felt that the way my hair looked, was a big part of my identity.

I did the same thing with clothing. I would search my drawers and cabinets for clothes I didn't feel like were nice enough for me to wear before. I started rocking these old, misfit and second hand clothes. I felt like those old dudes. Who seem to be completely unmoved by the fact, that they are wearing 20 year old trousers that have more holes, than I have stories to tell. I started to enjoy how little attention I would get in these attires, trough this I learned not to base my self esteem on my physical appearance. 

2020, after a few years of living like this. I was looking at some of my older pictures, I was taken back by how nice I looked back then. This got me thinking... What if I combine my current confidence and self esteem with the nice looks that I had when I was younger. Why should I have to pick one or the other. In this quest of peeling away layers of my personality. I realized that I don't have to give them up completely, I just don't want to use them as a basis for my identity.

2021, now I have been brushing my hair daily and I am thinking of filling my wardrobe with some new nice clothes. I won't stop dressing up like a bum when I feel like it, but I will no longer forbid nice things from myself.",bropill,1611142192,purussa,10,1,True,2021-01-20
Can someone give me an outside perspective?,"So I am in a weird position currently and I think it would help a lot to get a third party’s take on it. So I’m a freshmen in college, and recently I’ve started talking to a girl that I used to have a huge crush on for all of high school, even while I was dating my ex (we were together for all of senior year and had a messy breakup right before she went to college). A month or two ago this girl flat out admitted that while I was with my ex she also had a huge crush on me, which was news to me. I have the trifecta of mental illnesses (ADHD, severe anxiety, and on and off depression, plus I deal with depersonalization) and never thought I would ever have a chance with this girl. But now I know that had I not been with my ex I could have dated my high school dream girl (cringey I know but bear with me). But I don’t really know what to do about it now. I still really like her and whenever I see her it’s awesome, but I don’t know if she still feels the same way. She isn’t really super communicative, and sometimes I get the sense that she doesn’t actually want to talk to me and just does to be polite. We’ve hung out a few times fairly recently and every time it was nice, but I don’t really know what to think about it at this point.

"Found out someone I started talking to this past week has a boyfriend. Worse, this is the 6th time in a ROW this EXACT scenario has played out for me since April. What’s your approach when you’re dealing with rejection, or want to keep a friend you have feelings for?","I don’t mean to sound pompous, but I’m actually a pretty decent looking guy, and I’m very good at socializing and connecting with people. I’ve had my fair share of hook ups. I even have a friend who I meet for casual sex atm, which is a great release given the times. I struggle with depression and my work situation is precarious, but at the moment I feel healthy, I’m fulfilled by the work I have, and I feel ready as I can be for a relationship. 

This unlucky streak isn’t even causing self-deprecating thoughts. What’s killing me is that *every* woman I discovered I had feelings for during the past year has been seeing someone else by the time I initiate.

I’m happy for those who have a fulfilling partnership. But man, the compounding rejections just became too much. I’m actually having trouble speaking with a good friend because I can’t resolve my feelings for her, and even though I’m prone to crushes, this isn’t something I’ve struggled with in years.   

Obviously this is an exceptionally bad time to date, and being Jamaican-American I can say that dating while Black in a mostly white city comes with its own challenges. Then there’s the fact that some women (quite reasonably) fabricate a relationship if they’re simply not ready to date. Love can be a waiting game.

But it’s just like... Fuck, man. I could use someone to talk to about this. Yesterday was the straw that broke the camels back and I feel really bad lol.

Rent.,"I don’t know much about this sub so I don’t know if this post can get me banned bc not related to the sub, but if so, I’m sorry. I just know no place where i can talk about myself and have people understand me.


So I basically had a debate with my friend about whether prostitution should be seen as a bad thing by society, my friend thinking it should be seen as such. The debate was terrible, he constantly used logical fallacies and openly admitted he used his intuition instead of looking at the consequences of things to base his morals on. He finally left the vocal after I tried to (very calmly) explain to him why intuition is a very fallable way to determine your moral stances. I don’t think insulting people is a good idea but I think it’s perfectly fair to say it was very immature of him. Anyways, I’m used to that, it’s not the first time we debate, so I continue my life, and then I find out he blocked me on all social medias, and I have to talk to a common friend of ours to fucking communicate with him. He tells our common friend he won’t unblock me or talk to me irl to me because ""I’m a fucking r*tard"". And I have to excuse myself to him for ""having been a dick and having said stupid stuff"", even tho, I rethink of what happened and don’t see where I’m in the wrong. This isn’t the first time it happens, just the most frustrating because of specific reasons I won’t get into. Why? For also other reasons I won’t get into, if he doesn’t wanna talk to me, I’ll lose all my other friends for the time he ditches me. And he’s my best friend. Or.. was?

So I wanted to know if I’m tripping? Am I on the wrong? And I can’t ""just ignore him"": I don’t wanna spend another week alone. I just feel hopeless. Why are people so mean? Why can’t I have mature friends?

How I manage Social Anxiety,"Hello bros and sis, I have 2 techniques that I use in conjunction to diminish my social anxiety when it starts creeping up just as I'm about to go out of my house to visit friends or do whatever:

1. Meditate. Cliché, I know, but just like exercise, there is a reason meditation is so highly recommended by so many people. You'll have to try some different styles of meditation to find one that suits you. I do 10-20 mins and focus on self love and outward love, which really helps in social settings. For a free resource, walk through the classes in this program [https://meditation.org.au/class01.asp](https://meditation.org.au/class01.asp). 
2. Laugh. Before going out, and after meditation has calmed me down, I'll put stand up comedy on Youtube, or whatever funny material I have on hand. The laughter puts me in a laughing mood which stays with me all the way to when I meet up with people outside. People enjoy people who smile, when it's genuine. :D

This method takes me from dreading the social interaction to arriving relaxed and smiling! Hope this helps!",bropill,1608917935,PJ_GRE,9,1,True,2020-12-25
"Giving ""the talk"" to my brother - seeking advice","tldr: giving my 12-year-old brother ""the talk."" Any advice?? 

Hi - I don't know if this is the right place to post this but I need some input. I've been lurking in this community for a while and love the positive bro attitude that exists here and think it could give me some perspective. 

I (23F) am going to give my half-brother (12M, ""Mark"") the puberty/sex talk. We lost our mom about 3 years ago and his dad is a highly religious, hands off kind of parent and they have a rough relationship. I don't think the restrictive and untrue message (chaste until marriage, don't masturbate or your hands will grow hair, God will be angry if you touch yourself) Mark gets from church or his dad are helpful in any sense. I would rather give him the facts of puberty, self-touch, consent, sex, etc in a positive and accepting light.

I work in education and have had these kinds of slightly awkward/somewhat uncomfortable conversations with school-age kids before. The physical mechanics of male puberty and nature of consent are things I know I can teach him. I want Mark to know he can come to me with questions and be a safe resource for him, but I was never a 12-year-old boy having to go through this. 

What do you wish you knew when you were going through puberty? 
Did someone in your life give you a really good ""talk"" you can share with me? 
Is there a way to do this that won't traumatize my 12-year-old brother as I talk puberty and sex with him?

I don't know how to feel about my older cousin...,"One visit from my uncle's family made me really change my opinion on my cousin.

Basically, he's pretty much handicapped. When he was 7 (now 34) he had a brain tumor that damaged his hearing and he was hardly able to walk straight after the surgery. Sometime last yeat he completely lost his hearing and my uncle and aunt went out of their way to get him cochlear implants so he could hear again. I understand that speaking for him has been rough since he couldn't hear anything and was very depressed until he got the surgery and learned how to hear again.

When you talk to him, it feels like youre speaking to a 7 year old child. He only ever tells jokes and talk about one single TV show. One thing that really stuck with me was when him, my uncle and aunt came over for Christmas, his batteries for the external part of his hearing aids ran out. When he told my aunt she (understandably) got upset at him for not taking an extra set of batteries with him like she told him to. He then said this thing: ""you're my assistant, you should've done that for me"".

I don't know about you, but that really makes me feel bad for my aunt. She wants him to be at least somewhat responsible for himself, but he expects everything to be handed to him. They even moved from their perfectly fine appartment and built a brand new house just so he could get the dog he always wanted. They'd move the fucking moon for him and he talks to them like they're just assistants. I'm so dissapointed and I don't know how to feel anymore. 

Bros, I need your help. How am I supposed to feel about this? I really don't know.

"What is your opinion of a ""real"" relationship? Is it okay/normal to truly love someone even without a big spark? I am doubting myself after a break-up.","I need to give some backstory and I try to make it as short as possible:

I (M25) dated someone (F21) great for a while earlier this year. We were very sexually attracted to each other, could talk openly and, most importantly, being together felt like home. It was truly nice. A good friend of mine described us as a couple that just radiates a certain warmth when they're together and it was a beautiful compliment.

However, there was no explosion of hormonal feelings. It's not like I didn't feel something great when she said or did something sweet, but there weren't these giant butterflies in my stomach.

We were exclusive for all this time, but she broke it off after I wanted to make it officially official and confessed my love to her. Her reason was that there weren't this ""big"" feelings and she feels like she needs this to be absolutely certain this is what she wants and that was the end of our story. Actually, she never had a real relationship ever so far. I was shattered, because it all happened shortly after I made myself the most vulnerable to her yet. Maybe I should've waited a month or two for this, but it doesn't matter anymore.

A little later we talked and we found out that we actually had pretty much the same feelings for each other, but I took the leap and called it love while she did the opposite. She called it a very deep friendship with sex.

While no one wanted the other out his/her life, we had a very heartfelt farewell, since she cannot commit to this without having this absolute clarity of strong feelings and I of course do not want to be a glorified friend with benefits to someone I confessed my love to.

I respect and understand her decision and will never contact her again. There is no animosity from my side of course either, just hurt.

Now, I know what she is looking for, because when I was 18 I did experience this enormous being over the moon love with someone. It was great, but we eventually crashed because of circumstances and just generally being young and too inexperienced in relationships.

So I do know how big love can feel, but for some reason I don't think I need it anymore. This warmth and feeling of being home that she gave me was all I wanted and if I cannot call it love, what else would it be?

However, after all this I cannot help but doubt myself. Did I talk myself into loving her because I was lonely? On the other hand I am absolutely no one to throw love around lightly and she was the second person in 8 years I truly confessed feelings to.

Are you supposed to always have this giant spark? Is it silly to try and build a relationship without it? I have a lot of questions and conflicting feelings about this. I wish I could ask my friends, but they're pretty emotionally closed off and the ones that aren't cannot really understand what I mean.",bropill,1609091525,Avongrove,10,1,True,2020-12-27

Does anyone have advice or tips on coping with emotional distress?,"Hello all. I've been on this sub for a while, this is my first post. In part I'm doing it to vent, but also to make a request for any advice anyone might have.

To sum it up, I need advice on how to cope when I fall into despair.

I become anxious and depressed and angry quite unexpectedly. I see things or remember things that make me lose hope and fall into periods of despair. This has been happening to me for a long time and I think it's probably unavoidable. I'm a worrier by nature and I care about things deeply.

I've accepted that I'll probably always have what a counsellor once described to me as my ""storm-clouds"" that float into my mind and give me grief until they pass. I don't think I can avoid or prevent this from happening.

But when it does happen, it can be hard for me to concentrate on anything else and hard for me to rise above these periods of despair. I regularly lose sleep because of it and a lot of my waking hours too and the only thing I can do is breathe deeply, remind myself that the pain will pass and try to focus on positive, logical information to combat my negative, irrational thoughts.

So I was wondering if anyone had any further advice on how to cope with emotional distress and deal with it that they might have found to be effective. I'm in pain and it can come from the smallest, silliest things and it's hard to deal with.

How can I stop people feeling as sucky about life as I was as a teen?,"When I was a young lad, caught in the 2016 culture war of toxic masculinity and a vacuum of male role models, i was under the impression that I didn't matter and my story didn't matter because I was a straight white dude. 











This of course, is a weird line of logic because I was 16 and hyped up on sociology lectures and growing pains.  I thought the sociology of manhood and role models etc was a magic bullet to clear all my *actual* problems.











Now granted, I discovered I wasn't so straight, and could sidestep that whole deal later in my life. But I'm imagining the idea of one of my close guy friends telling me they felt that, and how I'd react with a mix of concern, shock, and ""dude of course you're important. You exist and you make peoples lives better.""











I was also under the impression that all masculinity that anyone could perceive as even remotely physically imposing was wrong, in case someone thought I was some kind of inevitable monster man. That I'd have to become a zen lotus flower of a person, (not my style), in order to not be perceived as bad. God 2016 was not a good time. 











Natalie wynn touches on this in her video about masculinity and it really resonated with me. The assumption of danger, and how that can have ... bad effects on a persons psyche. spoiler alert. Obviously manhood comes in many forms, and as long as you aren't bathing in blood, punching nuns, and eating babies, you're probably fine.

I want to change and be a better person - but I need advice; tldr at the bottom,"
Hi, I have posted a couple of times on here about my behaviour and how I want to change.  But now I have a few follow-up questions. 

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

Basically, on and off for about 18 months I used a fake profile and face photos from the internet to talk to men on Grindr. The nudes I sent were my real ones. The chats were often sexual, but I never shared any photos or chats with anyone else. I blocked everyone very quickly - often after a few hours, the longest was probably around a week. 

I used the fake profiles because I didn’t want to be found out as gay or have my face connected to my nudes. I wanted to be invisible but I also wanted to talk to men (it’s pathetic, I know).

My Realisation:

I stopped using this fake profile and deleted all accounts/chats/photos in September. But the guilt and realisation of what I was doing really hit in late October and has been severe since then.

I deeply regret that I’ve violated people like this - lying to them and deceiving them, especially because of the sexual nature of the chats. Even though I didn’t blackmail or share the nudes/chats anywhere, I feel disgusting and deeply regret that I’ve lied to people to even have those conversations in the first place. The idea that someone has been hurt by my actions is very troubling to me and I wish I could back and stop myself from behaving in this way. I never intended to cause harm or violate anyone - but I now know that’s exactly what I’ve done since the harm was in my lying and deceiving. There’s still wrong been caused by actions even if the people didn’t realise they were being catfished. 

Where I need advice: 

Since I stopped using the fake profile I’ve been seeing a therapist (for CBT and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, to help with my OCD/Anxiety and to help me act on my values not my fears) and a counsellor too. I’m trying to stop watching porn and have been reconnecting with my Christian faith. However, I unsure how to atone and make up for what I did. I know I can’t change the past, but I want to be better in the future and not behave like this again. What does accountability look like for someone in my shoes - what is the right thing to do. 

In previous posts I’ve made about this situation, people have advised me to not seek out the people I talked to on the fake profile to apologise to them. I believe this is because the people I was talking to likely weren’t forming romantic feelings nor were they likely aware I wasn’t who I said I was. This has left me with a few questions however:

1. Is it really okay to just move on and leave this in the past? To me it feels like something I deserve punishment for and like I owe many people an apology. But I also don’t want any apology I give to re-victimise or victimise anyone, especially if they didn’t know they were being catfished. I also don’t know if any apology would even help the situation here?

2. Do I need to tell my close friends/flatmates now about my behaviour? If your friend had been doing what I’ve done, what you want them to do to atone/make up for it.

3. Do I need to tell future lovers/boyfriends? I hate the idea that if at some point in the future people find out I was catfishing, that my boyfriend/husband/future kids would get dragged into the situation too. How would I go about telling a future partner? Or even if it was not my catfishing but my nudes that got found out (since the nudes were my real ones).

4. Is it okay to wait for someone I talked to find out it was me who catfished them or should I find the people I talked to and tell them it was me. I know what I’ve done was wrong and so should I seek out the people I’ve wrong to right the situation or will that cause them more harm? Like I don’t want to be projecting my own guilt onto them. 

5. This connects to the first question. I feel like predator and a monster, but I also have anxiety and OCD. This makes it hard for me to judge this situation objectively. I feel so disgusting and guilty - but people on other posts have said that my guilt is making me view this situation as worse than it is. Please tell me what your first reaction to my situation is. 

Basically, I just want to know what steps I can take to be better in the future, now that I’ve stopped Catfishing. I don’t want to be that person anymore - I want to contribute to the world and I want to make people happy and have a family - I just don’t know how to get there or if I even deserve that.  

Tl;dr - I was a catfish (used fake profile on Grindr) and often had sexual chats with people. I’ve now stopped but what steps can I take to be better in the future. I want to change.",bropill,1609150536,sadthrowaway0001,15,1,True,2020-12-28
I used to be a loving drunk (side note on depression),"But then I got too drunk too often, and found that getting drunk would ruin my mood regulation for upwards of a week afterwards.  I've been sober for almost three years now.

But, I'm more than OK with that.  I'm excited, happy, and a very loving sober man.  All those bursts of affection that would pop out when I was drunk have since come out when I was totally sober.  I love my friends.  I love my cats.  I love so many people, and it feels like my heart could explode from it all.  It's almost one in the afternoon, I'm a 27 year old man, and I'm about to cry because I just love my friends so much.

Absolutely *nothing* brought that on.  I'm struggling through the pandemic with some relatively shitty things in my life right now, but I still love my friends.  I can't be with them, but I can text and call them to let them know how much they mean to me, and I'm sober while doing it.  There's no question of whether or not I actually mean it (though I always meant it before). 

The moment has passed, and I am left with a warm contentment.  I love my friends, and they texted back they love me too.  I'm a lucky guy to have such wonderful friends.  I'm a lucky guy to have been able to cultivate a friend group where it's acceptable and welcome to express our direct love like this. 

In 2017, I was still having suicidal thoughts.  I went sober in early 2018.  April 11, actually.  Some other things turned around in my life, and since then regardless of my situation, I've been doing pretty OK at worst.  Even in this soul crushing pandemic, my mental health has remained stable.  It really does get better.  

Depression strikes me as a war of attrition.  You just have to outlast it.  No matter what.  If you can outlast it, you will come out on top.  You will never be the same person who struggled like you did before because you've learned from that miserable experience.  No matter what, if you can just survive, you will push your way into a better life.  You might not be like me with random bursts love for your friends, but you can and will make it.  I believe in you.  I know you can because I did, and I wanted to give up.  I swore so many times over that if I had to do it again, I would just end it, but I realize now that I will *never* have to do it again.  Even if the chemicals in my brain go out of whack or my situation tanks, I will never repeat exactly what I already went through.  I have new tools, new perspectives, new methods of handling the shittiest parts of my mental health so that even if my brain decides to go self-destruct mode, I can hold out until things get better.

You can too.

And I say this with confidence regardless of who you are, but **I love you.**  Keep going.",bropill,1609178222,SirWigglesTheLesser,3,1,True,2020-12-28

Sometimes things do just work out,"Tl:dr I got my literal dream job today and it happened when everything felt ready to collapse.

So, 2 months ago my roommate told my girlfriend and I that she was moving out in January. Last month my girlfriend found out her job was going to close her position due to budget cuts. I was super stressed because we couldn't afford our apartment on just what I was making. I felt like everything I had been building for the last 2 years was coming undone.

I scrambled into a job search because I figured if things are going down I might as well go down fighting. Today I got an offer from a job that pays exactly what I need to hold things together until my girlfriend gets back on her feet and, to make things better, it is exactly the kind of job I want to move my career into.

Really struggling.,"Hey bros, I decided to post here instead of the regular self loathing subs I usually do. 

I’m a pretty average guy. 4.5/10 looks on a good day. In decent shape, if not a little overweight. Bad skin has been a problem since puberty started (yes, I have a skincare routine).

I struggle with displaying emotions. I drift between mildly satisfied, and angry/sad. The very rare times where I am happy, it’s not for long.

Female attention for me is basically 0, which I don’t really care about anymore, I quit trying in high school. It’s still kinda hard seeing buddies with girlfriends sometimes.

Nothing is particularly wrong... I just feel empty. I have an absolutely loaded semester which starts in a few weeks which of course, is online. I barely have the motivation to get out of bed anymore. I don’t want to do therapy, for personal reasons, and all the things I use to cope aren’t fun anymore.

I’m a loser incel with no one to blame but myself.  It’s a lot of fun to blame “society” and other people but it’s all just endless coping. Sex wouldn’t do shit for me.

"Bros, I'm having trouble connecting with my family and I'm not sure what to do.","So right off the bat I'll tell you that I am not neurotypical. Simple stuff like eye contact is difficult for me, and in social situations I tend to just kind of shut down, because nothing I'm interested in or know about really ever comes up in conversation. This Christmas we went and visited my in laws (It's ok - just me, my wife, her parents and her brother - no long distance travel, everyone has been taking the lockdown very seriously and we've all been tested) but while at their house I tend to be sort of excluded. But I'm excluding myself by not talking/interacting and I understand that. I'm not blaming them, I'm blaming myself. My father in law is a very traditional, conservative blue collar southern man. He has attempted to bond with me over typical 'manly' stuff like football, hunting, and cars. Well, I'm not interested in any of that stuff and have no idea how any of it works. He'll ask me about 'the game last night' and I won't know, he'll ask me what team I like, I tell him I don't really watch football. He just gives me weird looks and moves on. Later he's trying to talk to me about cars - bros, the only thing I know about cars is that they have four wheels and will take me to work. I can change a tire but that's really it. If you talk to me about some cool car you saw I won't know what it is. I would try talking to him about things I'm interested in like computers but I know he won't get it and it'll just make him more uncomfortable.  


I think I also may have offended her mom. She was talking about the new kind of margarine she got and asked if I thought it was any good. I said I liked it but normally I just eat regular butter. I think she thought I was looking down on her for having margarine and not butter, but this is far from the truth. I mean, financially and socially they are both far above me and my wife. She said, ""Well, butter is just too expensive. Must be nice to be able to afford that."" This FLOORED me because I don't make hardly any money at all and she knows that. They live in a big fancy house with a huge yard and I live in a trailer park. I can barely afford groceries. But, you can get a pound of pure butter for like $2.00 at my grocery store so I'm just not understanding how she could have taken this as an insult. I've never seen margarine as cheaper than butter, to me it's always just been a simple preference. It's not even like I refused to eat it or anything - I did eat it, on my dinner roll, and it was completely fine. I had a really nice meal and made sure to tell them both thank you and mention how good it all was.  


I don't know, maybe this is all just an incoherent rant but when I'm with the in laws it's like I just don't even exist, and when I do exist, I'm making them upset without even realizing it. It makes me not want to go and visit them anymore. In honesty at this point (We have been married for 6+ years) I'm only going to make my wife happy, because I do not ever have a good time there and just wait for it to be time to leave.",bropill,1609262747,Nox_Aeons,2,1,True,2020-12-29
How can I fight the thought that my girl friends might be interested in me?,"Sorry if this doesn’t fit the sub. 

Hello bros, I need some help. 
Recently I learned something about myself, that I think goes for a lot of other guys. 
The notion that guys only befriend girls they think they have a “shot” at.

It made me think, because it relates to me, and I don’t like it. I have some good girl friends. All of these platonic relationships started of with me expecting romance or sex, but as it progressed I realised that it wasn’t going to work, and now they’re platonic. I want it to stay that way. 

However, every time they start a conversation, I think to my self for only a second “she want me”. Mostly because I’m used to looking for clues to tell if they’re flirting with me. I want that to go away, but I don’t know where to start.

I’m also in the best relationship of my life, with a girl I truly love, and I have nightmares about fucking it up because I act on the flirty impulses of other girls.

"imposter syndrome and self hatred is not very bro like, specifically the pre-medical community","Tl;dr: I hate myself even though I have tried as hard as I could, I sound like an asshole in this post

Hey bros. I've never posted to this sub before, so I'm not really sure where to start. I've just seen that this is one of the most supportive groups on reddit, and I just need somewhere to turn to get some help from bros. If I ramble, I'm sorry about that I just need to vent. Also I'm sorry I sound pretentious or like im bragging or anything, I just want to give background and tell my life story apparently because there's no one I feel comfortable talking to about this because they all just say I'm being crazy. Honestly, don't read this - I'm posting this mostly just to vent. This is all stupid shit and I don't want to waste anyone's time. This just helps with anonymity i guess.

I'm a senior at a US University studying bio, and I'm trying to get to med school. If any bros out there are also on the same path, you know how intense competition is and how rigorous the work is to finally get an acceptance. I've kind of worked my ass off for 4 years, and I'm at the finish line, and I'm so unbelievably terrified. It's such a crapshoot, and my stats aren't incredible. I have a 90th percentile MCAT (med school admissions test) (which I'm retaking) and a pretty decent GPA (3.83). I'm president of a couple clubs, officer in a bunch of others one having 860+ members, hundreds of hours of volunteering in hospitals, and thousands of hours volunteering outside of hospitals. I've tutored, I've TA'd classes like bio and ochem, and I do pretty intense research in my lab.  
You think I'd be happy with my accomplishments, right? Nope. I hate myself more than ever. I feel like a complete failure and even when typing this out the things that I've done feel disingenuous. I feel like when I look back I only see the failures, and it's all dumb shit. I see the B i got in ochem 1, or the A- I got in human phys. I set these stupid high expectations for myself, and when I don't succeed I self-deprecate. Pile that on day after day, year after year, and you learn to hate yourself, plain and simple. I simply can't focus on the good stuff without remembering the bad. I have done my best to be a good guy, and I have been. I know I'm a good friend, I will always consciously do things that are hard if it makes other people's lives easier. That's part of the reason why I want to go into medicine - I just like helping people and making them feel good. Can I be proud of myself for that? Apparently not. That fuckup in biochem I had sophomore year means I'm a flaming pile of garbage no matter what. I just feel so stupid all the time, and then feel stupid for not taking in the larger perspective. I've had these grandiose expectations for myself that I'd get into Columbia or Duke, and I just can't drill it into my stupid head that I'm just not smart enough, and my metrics show that. I don't even have a fallback of not having supportive friends or family - my family is made up of the most caring, genuine, intelligent, and wise people I've ever met, and every single one of my close friends is the same way. Even with these advantages and a good upbringing, I'm still so weak. I think about people who grew up in absolute shit and squalor, and became success stories despite the fact. I'm nothing compared to them - but I have a complex now where if I'm not the best I'm nothing which is SO TOXIC.  It's this entire mentality generated by the premed community that you need to strive and achieve perfection, otherwise you're going to fail. That's been ingrained in my mind and I can't get those feelings of failure to stop. Also I'm lonely and single as hell so that doesn't help. 

I don't know where this is going. Honestly I hope no one reads this because I sound super braggy and annoying in this post but if you got here and are experiencing similar stuff I feel u to no end. Pls do what I can't and learn how to take pride in your accomplishments without focusing on the ""failures"", especially if they're only failures to you.

How do you get over it when you watch a disturbing movie?,"This has only happened to me a few times in my entire life. Took me ages to properly process *A Clockwork Orange*, for instance, but that was decades ago. Seen a lot since and I've been fine. I thought I was passed this.

Well, yesterday I watched *Punishment Park* (1971) and here I am the next morning still feeling very messed up about it.

So I did research about the movie. Figured maybe if I got a behind-the-scenes look at it that would kick-start my ""it's just a movie"" internal process. 

But... no.

There's this 2004 interview with the director, Peter Watkins, talking about how much has been done by academics, film and TV executives to suppress the film. People who see a lot of movies got deeply upset about it, and even now decades later still work to make sure nobody sees it.

It's not gory. There's no nudity or rape. No children. It's just profoundly, deeply sad.

"2020 has been the year of rebirth,2021 will be the year of responsability","Hi bros,

2020 has been overall a good year for me. I'm 21. Despite the pandemic I managed to turn this time into progress. I feel a better person, more confident and more in control of myself.  I think that the biggest accomplishment has been understanding that we can't save everybody. Everyone is going through their own Journey and we must respect their choices, and be ready to be compassionate if they eventually understand that those choices were wrong. I am learning how to judge less.
The other great lesson is that nothing lasts. Hopelessness tells otherwise, that the pain you are enduring won't ever end, but that's a lie. Depression is like a wound. Take care of yourself early as soon as you notice that something is off, so that you can prevent the wound from getting infected. 


There is still a long way however ahead.  2020 has been the year of rebirth after the crisis I've fallen into in 2018, 2021 will be the year of responsability. I've now all the Tools, there won't be anymore justifications. I will show love to myself and I will bring him to the most beautiful and highest tips, I will give him everything he deserves.

Struggling with feeling empathy. Can I change?,"I've mentioned before that I fell down the nihilistic anti-sjw rabbit hole for ages, building para-social relationships with a group of hateful idiots and I got out of it just this year. I admitted to my few friends that I'd unquestionably digested all these toxic ideas but I was going to fix it and improve as a person.

Sometimes however I still feel like an asshole and wonder to what extent I can actually change. Sure, I've changed my political stance and values, but I'm not sure if I can ever become the loving, calm, understanding person I wish I was.

I even question whether I told my friends all that stuff just to feel better about myself, for their reassurance that I'm not a bad person, that I'm actually pretty cool.

I mean I can control some things, right? I can choose to try to be kinder to people. I can choose to try to be less judgmental about people's lives. 

But how much of it is simply in my nature to be apathetic? I grew up sheltered from the world, became a big-head at school and was subsequently rejected by peers at college, and that filled me with hate.

My Inexperience Plagues Me,"Hey bros, I’ve been having an issue that’s very prominent wherever I go basically. I grew up in a very exclusive community where I basically had no chance of really fitting in or to at least be in a steady friend group I got along with well. People are generally respectful to me, but other than that I, as well as lot’s of other’s here, are practically invisible. 

There’s so much I haven’t experienced that I would love to, but it’s just impossible to get these kinds of social connections growing up here. Especially now during covid, which doesn’t make me feel better at all because I know I kinda have to live with this for awhile. 

New Years sucks so much because I hear about all these people who don’t live that close to me going out with friends, getting drunk with friends, having a new year’s kiss, going to parties (obviously not necessarily this year, but some people still are which is even more upsetting).

The biggest problem is whenever I hear about other people’s plans or past experiences, I just feel so shitty. It’s honestly one of the worst feelings I’ve felt, like I’d rather get socked in the face than feel the envy and shame.

I want it to stop, I never get angry with anyone for it, but I will often get pretty hurt and it’s very difficult to hide sometimes. I don’t think it looks good on me when I’m talking with someone I like and I get hurt because I haven’t been to a party. It feels pathetic but I can’t help it. Does anyone relate to this feeling?

How to stop thinking about society too much?,"Hello bros! First of all, wishing you all a happy and healthy new year! Hope you fulfill your goals.

I got ""woke"" over the lockdown and over last year. I got into feminism, LGBTQ+, systematic racism, ableism, etc. Now I cannot unsee the subtle signs of racism, sexism, etc., everywhere. I am getting offended easily. I don't really care when people call be cuck, simp, etc. To be honest, I am the ultimate cuck described by the right-wing: feminist, LGBTQ+ ally, who is on a plant-based diet. The problem gets even worse because I live in Canada, but I am an Indian. So both the countries' problems get into my head. It gets worse, because I am from southern India and the amount of racism we face in our own cities by north Indians is pathetic. I was bullied in my own city being called the Hindi version of the N-word (most south Indians are dark), made fun of my language (not Hindi), and made fun of my culture. It is so weird that they come to our own city and were racist to us. 

Keeping that aside, I am getting too frustrated at the rampant insensitivity in our society. I grew up watching movies where a hero single-handedly brings changes in society, and I wanted to bring changes in society similarly (I know, I am ridiculous). But let us be real, I am only one guy, and many people wouldn't stand behind what I do. Because many are indifferent and busy with their own lives and I respect that. Some do not have the mental space to do it, and I respect that too. 

Governments are regulating women's bodies, taking away autonomy from people, telling people who they can and cannot love, etc. I cannot really sit silently or doing nothing. But I need to get my own life in order. I need to graduate, get a job, and things like that. I have never even been in a relationship or experienced romantic intimacy or even went on a date. 

I have a conflict. One side of me says study well, get good grades, get a good job, and learn to do well in your career, get married, buy a house, etc. It wants commitment and stability, and the freedom that it gets. Another side tells me to help people. To help fight oppression, violence against oppressed communities, and be a leader. It is difficult to have both. And I don't know where to draw a line. 

What is the grey area here? What is the thing where I strike a balance? Even now, I am planning to donate a bag of rice and dry beans on my birthday so the poor can eat, that's the most I can do with the little I have. But staying down, not caring as long as I am happy makes me feel guilty. Whoever the person is, I want to help empower them. My mom always told me that I need to take along people for success, not step on them. She is a successful entrepreneur and I trust what she says. Where do you guys think is the line?

I’m so tired of the idea that only girls struggle with eating disorders,"TW: discussion of anorexia

Alright. I’ve struggled with an eating disorder since for about as long as I can remember. It began as me not having enough time to eat during lunch in school and kind of just progressed. Last year was my freshman year of college and I lost 20 pounds. Then the whole quarantine thing hit and I had to move home and I lost even more because I completely lost my appetite. I’m now trying get back to healthy weight but my entire image of my body is so morphed that I don’t really know what I look like and feel fat even though I know I’m still technically underweight. 

I go to a therapist but I don’t know how to bring this up to them because literally everything online about anorexia is about how teenage girls fall victim to diet culture and think they’re fat. But I’m not a teenage girl. I’m a 20 year old dude who cried the other day because i had to eat or else I’d pass out. It’s just so tiring not seeing other guys struggle with this. People talk about how male body builders can have orthorexia and how some guys struggle with binging but I still just can’t relate to that. Obviously I don’t want anyone else to have to go through this but it just feels really lonely being the only guy in a lot of these spaces. And it sucks even more when I do tell someone and they say I can’t have anorexia because I’m a guy. It’s not like I chose this. It didn’t start out this way. But now I can’t stop body checking or obsessing over food. And it sucks because so many social things are centered around food so I feel like I have to miss out on things because I don’t want people questioning why I’m not eating. It even took me a long time to even admit that I had a problem because I kind of believed everyone when they said that only girls have anorexia. But now I’ve accepted the truth and it hardcore sucks.

2. Start a YT channel that is an educational leftist channel, but also be knowledgeable enough myself to help people. I know there’s a lot of channels already like this, so it may not be exactly this.

High school has been a shit time for me.,"I just wanted to let this out since it's been weighing me down for a while now.

8th Grade: Probably the best year of the lot. I was socially active, academically sound and was all around content with life.

9th Grade: Things begun to turn sour here. I had a bit of a bullying problem which ended withe the bully getting a broken nose from yours truly.

10th grade: oh, man this was a terrible year. So my ""friends"" had an entire WhatsApp group which I didn't know about. They would use to talk shit about me and spend whole weekends doing this. They even considered giving me the wrong date for a party just so I could be out of their hair, or at least until Monday. I got saddled with a useless Math teacher and I was forced to drop down to a lower level math class.
Mom moved out and me and my sister went with, this actually turned out to be a good thing in  the long run. Aforementioned failures at a romantic relationships that you read all about it on my post history. 

11th grade: I decided that I would turn things around except covid went in on a world tour and shut my country down.

I did online classes until we went back to school for finals. I aced them, until I got a phone call telling me that I failed the year because of a low English score. Luckily this was resolved and I'm going to 12th grade. 

To wrap up this novel of a post, high school has been a shitstorm of few highs and many, many, many lows. I'm at my wits end with goddamn school and I want it to end. It infuriates me that people like this can live awesome lives knowing full well what they've done.

I did okay in the first set of exams and then I decided that I would work my ass off for the next one and get better marks. And that's what I did. The thing is that despite all that hard work I put in, my marks weren't all that different. They went from around 62% to 81%.

I think it's time to talk about this; Do you fear being accused of rape? [big TW all over this thread],"There's a discussion that periodically flares up (especially during the height of the #MeToo movement) where main really really want to talk about false rape accusations and the potential affect on their lives. They say that adopting a norm of believing victims gives women the power to hand out social death sentences with no possibility of appeal. 

The typically response from feminist leaning people is that rape accusations are exceedingly rare (which is correct). They will typically go on to turn the concern around and say that if you're really worried about being accused of rape, that that's most likely your guilty conscience realizing that you have shitty ideas about consent, and maybe even have possibly raped someone but didn't even realize it because you feel so entitled to sex you can't even tell when you don't have consent. This person is often correct.

A third party will come in and say that the whole question of false rape accusations is a derailment. It is deliberately steering the discussion into a brick wall of intractable disagreement in order to drown it in an infinite grinding shit-nonsense-tornado. This person is often correct too. 

This is a cycle I have witnessed over and over. Why does it keep coming back? 

For starters, it falls right in line with well-established reactionary tactics. Reactionaries (the clever ones anyway) will avoid saying how they actually feel about a touchy issue. Instead, whenever they are in a public space like Twitter, they appeal to the uninitiated middle whenever possible in order to recruit them. 

In the case of women's bodily autonomy, reactionaries and fascists are flatly against it. They want women to give them free sex and white babies etc. But you can't lead with that in a room full of normies. So instead they will say, ""well what about false rape accusations""? 

And here's the insidious thing about this question; being falsely accused of rape absolutely would be awful, one of the most awful things someone could live through. (*Really? More awful than actually being raped?* I hear some of you getting ready to type. You're right, and I'm getting to that. Just bear with me.) Being falsely accused of rape would be awful. Which means that to your average onlooker, anyone who fails to show concern over false rape accusations looks like a callous, fanatical mecha-feminist. 

But false rape accusations are not part of the #MeToo discussion because of people who are concerned for the well-being of men. No, false rape accusations entered the discourse because of anti-feminist reactionaries. So what that means is that almost any feminists who spend any time at all online will immediately go to DEFCON 1 when someone brings up the topic. They know that they're being concern trolled. So they don't engage with the topic. Instead, they dismiss the troll. And dismissing the troll is arguably the best thing to do. 

But the splinter of it is that now, you have an interaction where someone is saying, ""but what if somebody gets falsely accused of rape?"" and another person is responding with, ""fuck off Nazi."" And although those of us who are innoculated to the bullshit of internet ""debates"" might understand why that's happening, *most people do not.* It looks very very bad, and I don't know what to do about it. 

**But here's what all of that does:** 

This whole situation makes the issue of false rape accusations impossible to discuss honestly. It has become so hotly radioactive that nobody is willing to touch it. Just by bringing it up, you look as if you're prioritizing men's feelings over women's bodily autonomy. You send people's troll detection into overdrive. 

False rape accusations may be exceedingly rare, but they are also not nonexistent. A friend of mine had sex with his longtime girlfriend in college while they were both intoxicated. Although she later recanted, completely dropping the accusation, he ended up being arrested, going to court, having to describe details of intimate acts. His family was dragged into it, he had to hire a lawyer. In the end, her case didn't hold water and my friend was free to go. 

Is that as bad as being raped? Of course not. But there are a lot of horrible things in this world that you wouldn't want to have happen to you which are not as bad as being raped. As a survivor of sexual assault myself, I think I can at least speak to that. 

There is a reason that concern trolling over false rape accusations works so well as a recruitment tool, and I think it's that it terrifies more men than are comfortable admitting it. Men have learned that the only publicly acceptable position to take (without siding with reactionaries) is that they are so confident in their understanding of consent, and so trusting of all women, that they cannot conceive of ever being in danger of a false accusation. But I think the truth is more complicated than that. I think that everyone fears betrayal at least some of the time, and we all fear situations where we wouldn't have any control or recourse. And I think we are all horrified at the thought of being hated, having our reputation destroyed, being thought of as a monster and having absolutely no way to come back from it in spite of being innocent. However unlikely that scenario is, it's too nightmarish to avoid thinking about. 

I think that it is a fear that deserves a place of discussion, and I think that a male-focused feminist space like this one is a good place to do it.

So I want to know; are you afraid of being falsely accused of rape?",bropill,1609718392,WeaselSounds,111,1,True,2021-01-03

She (and every close friend of mine actually) repeatedly ask me to see a therapist, because I were showing the symptoms of bipolar. And i had an irrational fear about going to see a therapist (because I’m bisexual and i was afraid that the gov could create a list of lgbt+ people through psychologist/psychiatrist or something). I’m glad that when she ask me to break up, i wasn’t in my extreme manic/depressive episode, so I can handle it pretty nicely.

But idk he was different... he’s my first relationship after I can accept that I’m bi. It feels like it was my first time dating again, even tho the only thing that changed was my partner’s gender. The feeling that I got when we hold hands together in public (in a country where homophobia is the norm) is inexplainable, both the fear and the excitement from the adrenaline rush.

But we didn’t stay long in relationship. With the lockdown of both of our uni, I decided to go back to my hometown, and that’s my first fault, I rushed to go back to my hometown, leaving him without proper communication (we weren’t living in the same apartment). After a bit of fight, things seemed fine, and he also went back to his hometown. But suddenly he broke up with me, with only “I can’t do Long-Distance Relationship, and tbh I’m still afraid of the commitment” as the explanation, even tho he’s the one that tell me he want to try to do the relationship thingy. And after that, he start to stop communicating with me

Things... got wierd however after that. He started to contact me again. First, when Eid, he text me the usual stuff you text when its eid, but in the end he ask me wether I’ll be back to the town-where-our-uni-located. Then, when I attend a big protest about a controversial bill, he ask me if I attend the protest in my hometown or the uni-town.

I finally got back to the uni-town, because my prof ask me to do something in our lab that can’t be done online, and I had to do it because I’m lab assistant, he somehow got back to the uni-town too.

Because I was bored, I install Tinder and upgrade it to gold because its on discount, and... I saw him swiping me right... I don’t know what kind of game he want to play honestly...

Now he’s dming me my instagram, and idk... I feel like I don’t want to open my instagram because of it. I don’t know what I feel tbh, am i anxious? idk... to be honest, I still sometime miss him, or atleast miss his lips and body, but idk... I just want my brain to act normal again...",bropill,1609766648,spacefillingcurves,4,1,True,2021-01-04
I can’t do it anymore,"I can’t. I’ve had depression and anxiety since elementary school. Everything scares and hurts me all the time. I have the most fucked up relationship with anything where I’m supposed to do something, not bc I’m bad at any of it, I know I’m a decent student teacher, grad student, friend, brother, but if I’m really honest it all just makes me want to curl up and die. 

The bad part is that I am better. I’ve gotten help. I have meds that work well; my mind is clearer, I can think without hating existence every other breath, get out of bed the days I have to and all that. I’ve been to a couple therapists and none really made a difference. I journal and broke myself most of the way out of eating disorders and self harm over and over til I’m relatively stable I’m my 20s. But everyday that I’m not obligated to do something, like go to school or work or a protest, all I want is to lay in bed and sleep. Pretend it doesn’t hurt. I can’t cry anymore since starting testosterone (as a a trans dude) but I think if I could I’d still be crying everyday. Everyday I wake up in a panic and w self hatred (and I’m a biology teacher, not a flex just that inevitable the fact capitalism and climate change will either kill or beat down non rich ppl is always on my mind). 

I can’t do it. I’m so many ways I wish I’d never gotten help. I wish it all still hurt more so maybe suicide would feel like an option again, as terrible is that is to say. I just want it to stop. I don’t want it to hurt anymore. I don’t want to go to class today I want to stare at the wall until I start to withdrawl from my meds and can’t think anymore. I don’t know what to do. Thanks.

I feel as if a small piece of me wouldn't mind if someone touched my crotch or even engage in sexual acts after I had passed out.

I'm fuckin' scared of losing control of myself.,"The more news I see about X person grooming kids or Y person committing sexual assault, the more I feel that our sense of morality is so easy to corrupt or destroy. I'm still young, but a part of me is scared of suddenly becoming the person I swore I will never become.

I fear the day I somehow become successful and then slowly have that same success go over my head. I don't wanna lose control of my sexuality and ignore the idea of a ""no"". I don't wanna end up thinking one day that a minor would make a good GF. I don't wanna lose control of my anger and end up killing someone. Even seeing a knife or a sharp object is enough to scare me, because the first thing I think about is the possibility of me suddenly grabbing the knife to stab someone.

I'm not sure, but the amount of allegations being thrown around nowadays gives the illusion that these kinds of crimes are more common than we thought.

Dealing with losing my ex as a friend,"I'm 16, and my first girlfriend broke up w/ me a couple months ago. This is fine, really. I'm cool with just being friends, and we parted on the best terms I could ask for. She has a new bf now, and he seems way better for her than I was. I still have some anger and sadness about the whole thing, but I know that'll pass with time.

The problem is that while I'm fine with just being friends, it doesn't even seem like we're friends anymore. We don't have any classes together, so I have no opportunities to talk to her more than once every couple weeks. Before, when she was in a bad place (which she usually is), she'd talk to me about it, but now her boyfriend's taking care of that. I've tried talking to her online, but she ignores most of my messages. At the same time, she doesn't seem uncomfortable when we do talk, and it doesn't feel like she's actively avoiding me. I feel like I've lost all contact with her, and I really want to get back to being friends again, but I don't know where to even start.

I feel terrible to give up my lofty goals for my mental and physcial health,"I used to be super ambitious two years ago before I started college. Now, after failing five courses in college, and getting kicked out of computer science, I do not know anymore. I want a good lifestyle, but I want to make sure my sanity is not taking a hit. In the first year of college, I was extremely anxious while doing math and computer science courses, because those were something that I was quite slow to get. My anxiety took a huge spike, that I started avoiding work and worried day and night. Sometimes, I went a week without sleeping and worrying if I would be able to pass the courses, which I did not. My GPA in year 1 is 1.1. I failed four courses. And I am an international student in Canada, 10k miles away from family. I was all alone and did not know how to handle it. I became overweight, my skin had breakouts and my hair started getting white. My mom was shocked when I returned home for summer.

University gave me a chance and told me that I need to get a minimum of 2.3 to be removed from probation. I had to change my major to Psychology for higher grades. I can get back to computer science, and want to, because despite that field making me want to kill myself, that is the only way I can get a stable job and permanent residence and not return to my country, India. Again, I would rather kill myself than live in India.  I did not do that well in semester 3 (get 2.0), but failed a course in semester 4 in the first half of 2020 because the pandemic triggered my anxiety again. I was not able to return home for several months until recently, and again, I went home in a terrible state. I lost 12kg last year when I went home and gained almost 17kg during the pandemic. Again, I looked terrible, with unkempt hair, a little swollen eyes, etc. 

My anxiety spoiled my physical health too. Sometimes, it leads to hypotension. I get weak, dizzy and everything slows down. So I decided that I need to put my health as the topmost priority. But that means I need to sacrifice working long hours on learning additional programming as I am not taking any computer science courses. I need to sacrifice my future career dreams of high paying jobs or entrepreneurship for that. It means that I have to stop fantasizing about flying business class or living in a high rise apartment in downtown Toronto. Because jobs or careers which enable such a lifestyle do not come without sacrifices. And to have such careers, you need to bust ass to learn necessary skills. 

Every time I see what it takes to have a great career or have entrepreneurial goals, it always means sacrifice. Sacrificing health, sacrificing sanity, sacrificing relationships. It is not as if I am in a relationship, I don't even think any girl would be attracted to me, but at least personally, that means giving up on health. I do not know whether I need to give up my sanity again. I am going through therapy, but I feel therapy is making me mediocre. I feel therapy is making me settle for less, by accepting some things. Whenever I listen to/about successful people, they are super ambitious. They are willing to die for their goals. And I feel terrible that I am not ready to do that. Bezos, Musk, etc., used to be my role models and used to inspire me. But the moment I learn about atrocities they commit or any big businesses commit, I started hating them, and in turn myself. I feel like I cannot be ambitious without being a psychopath or a sociopath. Yet these are the people admired, extremely successful, and have amazing lifestyles. 

I feel like I am weak. I feel like I don't have what it takes to be big. And the thought that I will end up in a mediocre job with mediocre pay made me suicidal (my therapist handles this well). I am not even doing a major which pays, yet a major which I thoroughly enjoy but dreaming of a major which makes my life miserable yet pays well. I grew up with the line ""I'd rather be miserable in a mansion than happy in a hut."" And that rings true for me. I want to discuss these in therapy, but as I said, I fear becoming mediocre. I don't want to accept myself as a mediocre guy. It feels so bad. And being brutally honest, the fact that I going to the therapy itself makes me feel bad. Let us assume that somehow I have skills and sacrifices for a high skill job. Will employers hire a weak-minded person? If I continue therapy, will that affect my job opportunities? Will my history of anxiety threaten chances of career advancement? I really have no idea.

It feels so lonely, to be honest. And I also hate sometimes I resent my friends, whom I love with all my heart. Every time I see videos of people saying you are an average of five people you spend time with, I resent my friends. There was a time when I cut off my friends because they were average, tried to be friends with high performing students who were just a bunch of meanies, and ended up lonely throughout my high school. However, two friends chose to remain by my side, whom I always stay in touch with despite being in different countries. And even in Canada, I sometimes feel I need to associate with rich students or ambitious students who get great grades and are entrepreneurial. But again, I don't vibe with them well. I feel like a terrible person for resenting my friends who were, are, and will be there when I'm having a bad time. 

When I take care of my health like sleeping enough, going to the gym every day, cooking meals, etc.,  I have to lose hours which I can put for work. Now it is education and towards getting high grades, in future it is job or business. I feel bad that balance is not something that ambitious people aspire for. I feel bad for not having goals strong enough that I ignore everything in pursuit of them. I feel bad that not aspiring makes me even less desirable given my ethnicity, height, weight, etc. Even when it comes to working out, I feel terrible when I workout for the sake of health. I feel terrible if I do not eat a bodybuilding diet to sculpt a perfect six-pack body. 

Therapy helped me in a way that I understand the need to accept myself and lower my standards for the sake of my mental health. But my mind is so rigid on goals and social status, that I cannot wrap my head around it. Ambitious people are the successful ones. They are the ones who hold the most power and popularity. Models and actors put their bodies through hell for their goals. They endure a lot of hormonal changes, dehydration, etc for their ambitions. Meanwhile, I am here going through therapy and becoming mediocre in life. 

I feel extremely terrible when I want a stable life. When I think of having a life where I have a stable job, a stable marriage, and stable life in general, I feel like a lesser human while many I went to school with are in Yale/Harvard/MIT, going for the stars. I hate my body and my mind for being so weak, that either I have to choose them with a mediocre job (because I am mediocre), or an illustrious job by ignoring everything and going for it.

I feel part of the reason why I see things in black and white is that I am not that great at coding or math. Also, I am taking five years to complete my degree. I would have had a chance to get back into computer science if it wasn't for the pandemic. I am competing with the top students from my university, the top students from the topmost universities going through grueling training. These are the ones who are going for high-paying jobs. They already have a headstart by completing their degree with great grades, internships, personal projects and achievements, and in four years. Whenever I think of it, I feel I need to work way harder than them to get to where they are, often sacrificing everything and focusing completely on work. 

P.S.: I am in no way patronizing people who choose such a lifestyle. It is amazing that you can be satisfied a fulfilled in your life and have your priorities in order. It is me who does not want such a lifestyle, and completely my own thing. I grew up idolizing stress, high ambition, and psychopathic - narcissistic traits, so it is difficult to wrap my head around some stuff.

Dating as a guy seems really overwhelming,"Im not really ready to dip into dating again but I think I have lots of disillusion with the whole dating game that I was hoping people could clear up. Its been a year since my ex left me and Im not over it. The thing that scares me is that dating seems like its all for personal gain, not mutual connection. My ex used me until I no longer served her and threw me away when I needed her. Since then she's been sleeping around a lot, and I know its none of my concern but I just don't get how someone can do this so soon after a relationship. I've tried sleeping around but god damn it makes me depressed, there's no joy it's just dark and cold hedonistic stuff. 

Now I just have this feeling that girls have it so much easier than guys when it comes to dating (which makes me worried I'm holding a misogynistic belief). But it seems like they have a lot more options and us guys are just supposed to compete and constantly prove our worth. Im depressed as fuckkk and don't have the energy for people who don't see me as special enough to commit to. So I just feel like isolating myself all the time and not ever going after a relationship.

Anyone taken time out and gone to university later?,"Hey bros,

So I'm at a crossroads in my life at the minute. I went through GCSEs and a level (high school basically) without putting much work in. To speak candidly, I'm smart, I knew it but because my grades were always *good enough* I never really pushed myself that hard. I went to uni, did a year of chemistry, and now, after going into second year I've decided to drop out.

The thing my parents are pushing me to do is reapply (deadline: 15th Jan), but I don't know if I want too. I've always been very STEM but I really wish I'd gone down a humanities route. I've always just kind of drifted through life and I've realised I only did chemistry/STEM because its basically what people told me to do. I've  definitely been addicted to video games before. I just look back on my life and feel so much regret: so much time wasted, so little time spent developing my interests or being productive.

It kind of comes to this: I want to take some time out, get a job, work, then come back to uni in my mid or maybe late twenties with some actual life experience under my belt. My parents are really pressuring me to go back, I bought it up to them but they counter it because of the coving situation,  in terms of getting a job and that. I hate to be a downer but everything's just so irreconcilably shit at the moment. I am very depressed, and not to be too edgy, but when I talk to my parents they certainly don't know what it's like to feel completely incapable. 

Anyway, the point: has anyone gone to university later like this? I wanna take some time out don't I don't know if ill be ""missing out"" or whatever if I do.

"hey bros, how can i cultivate more positivity around being a man with a vagina?","22 year old trans guy here--- 

so the other day i made the mistake of scrolling through a twitter thread where people were posting their favorite words for vagina (mine is 'shaft') and loads of them were hilarious (like ham wallet and pink lasagna etc), but then other people were posting this fucking hideous gendered terminology like 'lady bits' and 'lady parts' and 'lady cave' and it made me want to just hammerfist myself in the fucking face and throat until i choked on my own blood.  and now, maybe four or five days later, i'm in this agitated funk where i can't concentrate on music or art for longer than several minutes until i hear a voice in my head whispering 'lady bits' and then it feels like i'm curled up naked on the floor of a locker room getting kicked in the stomach over and over again-- which almost makes me want to go out and get beat up because then my pain would be more real.   

and i'm just stuck at this semiotic impasse where i'm so fucking jealous of everybody with a penis cause penises just feel so androgynous whereas vaginas feel like a fucking life sentence on an island prison of gender; what makes it worse is the fact that when i imagine myself with a dick i don't feel euphoric or anything, i just get this sort of shrugging that's-beside-the-point feeling of ambivalence about it.  so ultimately it's not even that i really \*want\* to have a penis-- it's that i want to be unquestionably a man and also have a vagina that other people intuitively understand as masculine but i feel ashamed because all the laws of innuendo are against me.  i fucking wish that other people thought of pussies as inherently unisex like elbows so i didn't have to explain shit or feel unwelcome on this planet. 

but i know i can't just reach into other people's brains and change the way they think about the world and i can't wait around for the certainty that other people will accept me as i am---- so for starters, how the \*hell\* do i get these bullying intrusive thoughts out of my head?  also, question for other guys with pussies-- how do you interact with/take ownership of it in a masculine way?",bropill,1607722174,OrsonWellesInASarong,99,1,True,2020-12-11

Salam Comrades,"I’m a tiny bit convinced that I may not be 100% mentally stable. I’m suicidal at times, and when I’m stressed my emotions fluctuate from crying to neutral, literally instantaneously, i am becoming so forgetful that daily habits are erased from my memory. I hallucinate often, I can’t sleep sometimes, there are moments when I feel like there is someone behind me and it’s slightly annoying. I have a fear of men because of my father and some not very fun memories I’ve had with older men when I 5. I think you can guess without me going into detail. I stare blankly at the most inappropriate times and it doesn’t feel like I have much control over it, and I’m just so afraid that all of my family members will turn their back to me and I have a suspicion that my family (who have done so much for me) actually hate me. 

My mother is heaven on earth. She’s very understanding and she’s lovely. But she’s a bit old school when it comes to mental health. She doesn’t understand it and believes that a lot of it is bad habits and thoughts. I tried to open up to her once and she told me “here, come and read this book, habibi.” It was some book by a catholic priest that was about finding your inner potential and having complete mastery over your thoughts. I tried to tell her once about the hallucinations and she tried to help me by giving me a video to watch about “how to break bad habits.” My mom means well. She really does.

How do I flirt irl?,"So I know this is a bit of a dumb question, but this is something that my anxious ass can't wrap my mind around. Like I think what I understand what flirting is, and through text I think I'm not terrible at it. But that's only because I have hours to overthink and come up with a response lol.

I hate the idea of making someone uncomfortable, and following the advice of PUA feels creepy too me.

Having trouble with the first step (cw: suicide),"New to the sub, not sure if content warnings are usually used, but it can't hurt.

About 6 weeks ago, one of my closest friends took her own life. Shortly afterward, her mom, reading one of her journals, learned that she was trans (for clarity, trans woman assigned male at birth; at the request of her mom I have been using feminine pronouns and her preferred name as per the journal).

I'm not so arrogant as to believe that I was closer to her than anyone else, but she was genuinely one of my favorite people in the whole world, and working through her death has been very difficult, to say the least. I'm fortunate enough to have access to counseling through my mom's health insurance, but for one reason or another, I can't bring myself to make the call and schedule an appointment.

Truth be told, I'm scared. I'm scared that if I accept her death and move on, that one day I'll forget her. Her quirks, her laugh, her eyes. I'm so terrified of moving on but I feel so horrible right now. The thought of never seeing her smile again hurts me so bad.",bropill,1607764034,Machalett,3,1,True,2020-12-12

One of whom was a girl who kept trying to get at me.

I was more or less ok with it (and in part really liked getting this much attention) but when she tried to kiss me I got kind of uncomfortable and kept pushing her away. She was really persistent which in retrospect was pretty bad, but overall it was just kinda a weird situation. I don't really know how to feel about it, because it was kinda pleasant but also felt weird and idk if I'm just touch starved or if I should have made different decisions or what.

Im debating if I want to potentially go to a psych ward? (Please help),"Yo. Been suicidal for a while, got a therapist. Recently I've been doing more and more dangerous things, like cutting my throat with a knife (my suicide plan). Crying, deppressed, you know the drill. I'm getting nervous cause I planned my suicide for the 20th and my intent is still pretty stern? 
Like the throat cuts (not severe cuts mind you) is meant to hype me up for the big day so I don't chicken out like I have for other attempts.
I have a therapy session on the 18th so if I choose to I can talk about my therapist about my plan. But...
I'll defiently get locked up, and is it really worth it? I mean - all that stress and for what? I can't see a future past the 20th. This is so frustrating I don't know what to do. 
Plus, do I even deserve that extreme of treatment? I mean hell I've never been hospitalized for an attempt and my self harm scars aren't even that deep nor plentiful, so I feel I could handle this on my own, but if that were true I wouldn't be suicidal, no?

The truth is I'm scared. Not of my suicidality, but of the ward. What if I come out worse than I went in, like I said I'm not even that messed up. What if I get misdiagnosed with something? That could potentially ruin my life. I've had sucidal urges before and I fought it off. Well, the times I attempted I didn't cause someone caught me. But after that I bounced back, maybe I just need time?

A psych ward is the real deal, that's intense. My condition may not deserve that intensity. But, if I tell my therapist about my plan, method, date and intent - I'll be shipped off. Plus I'll return to a stressed out family and I don't want that.

What should I do?? Do I be honest or sort of steer the ship myself? I don't want to be prescribed something to take that might mess with me mentally, or treated for something I don't have, or be teased by the other inmates and so on. That sounds unpleasant. 

I know the answer is the ward is better than death. But could you guys imagine what that entails for me? That's scary and they'll probably fuck me up even more. And I don't want my family to know I'm intensely suicidal and have been for a long time, they'll be so ashamed of me. But also I can't stomach the idea of living another day like this??

What should I do I'm so stressed? I'm a total failure of a human. God, what a disaster I am to fail this miserably in life. I want to just go through with it. I know myself enough that if I just get enough bravery and enough ""hype"" beforehand I could totally kill myself successfully. But is this really the best way? Am I even mentally distressed enough to deserve to be in a psych ward? What do I know I'm just a stupid fucking deppressed teenager, there are millions others just like me so what makes me so fucking special. 

What do I do?",bropill,1607801463,seb69420,53,1,True,2020-12-12
"TW I think I have raped a close friend of mine, I don't know what to do","I was just at my close friend's house, we like to kiss and feel each other and sometimes I finger her if I get a yes from her, today she tried giving me a handjob for the first time.

I have absolutely no idea why, but it took me an embarrassingly long time to reach climax, but it did feel good, at multiple points it felt like I was about to finish, at which I told her to speed up, to which she responded with in a kinda giggly way that her arm hurts, but I kept telling her to continue despite the pain in her arm, it happens to me when I finger her, I thought, so it was normal. This happened about 4 times over all

She kept kissing me and putting my hand on her breasts, everything seemed completely normal, until the last time were I told her to speed up, at which point she said again that her arm hurts and then I finally understood that these were ways for her to ask me to stop and I got up and said, ""do you want to stop?"". She said yes and started to cover her face and cry.

I don't know what to do, I feel so ashamed of myself, I'm a rapist, I'm a horrible person, she wants us to keep being in touch and she tells me she feels godawful. I have just traumatized another human being, even after calling myself a feminist and anti sexual violence, hell, I'm a victim of sexual violence myself so how could I do this to someone.

How am I supposed to carry on with my life. How am I supposed to let other people love me, and say nice things about me. How am I supposed to bring consequences to other men who have raped when I'm just as bad. What do I do",bropill,1607812331,Lavnin_Hakruv,5,1,True,2020-12-12

Currently my plan is wait a few months, about 2  (taking all precautions still), then see how it turns out. I want someone to knock some sense into me and  explain it because its just scary.

Abandoned messages on Whatsapp,"Ah, many times I started writing a paragraph to a friend about how strongly I remembered this single thing they said years ago, and how I made that a part of my own, and how much a difference it had made to my life. How fondly I remember my time with them as classmates, colleagues, or just as friends, and how it soothed the passing of time. How, alongside splitting the bill for a lunch held thirty minutes ago, I would like to tell them how much I enjoyed it, how it refueled me with much-needed joy to share spaghetti with them.

And how many times I’ve abandoned those messages. How I’d just stick to the formal part; splitting the bill or silence altogether. Because I’d be certain they wouldn’t remember such a moment or didn’t catch the feeling. Unsure whether I could say such a thing, because it’s not something people do among each other do — so out-of-the-blue, so unsolicited. I’d convince myself it’s better to delete what I just wrote and forget about it.

i've kinda felt this way for while now and my opinion kinda sways back and forth every so often. my whole life i've sorta been the 'nice guy', i always wanted everyone to be my friend, i always avoided confrontation and i love watchin wholesome content as opposed to the opposite. this was obviously fine as a kid but i've noticed as i've gotten older that that behaviour is seen as 'immature' or 'soft' now or it's only really admirable if ur conventionally attractive 😂. ofc i know people who genuinely carry those opinions are wrong to say that but i guess it's just hard to believe otherwise when everyone around you pushes that narrative. 

i am a (M 18) so i always kinda chalked it up to people just being immature or showing out for their friends which probably is the case but sometimes i just feel like they're right. more specifically in regards to the confrontation thing, i always thought i was the 'mature' one or the 'bigger person' for refusing to resort to violence but is that just me justifying my own beliefs? i've had friends and family tell me i'm soft and i need to toughen up but i always just kinda thought why? like yeh ofc it's good to be tough and to be a strong person but i've always felt comfortable the way i am (or maybe not as much as i thought 💀)

State of the Subreddit discussion,"Hey bros!

&amp;#x200B;

This Subreddit has grown so much since last year when it was first created!

Incredible! I love this community so much and when I was just recently  asked if I wanted to help out as a mod I said ""yes of course!""

But while the subreddit has grown, it has also developed away from it's original form. r/bropill used to be focused on wholesome content and memes about postitive masculinities and being kind to one another. The past few months there has been a large amount of content asking for advice and venting.

Of course we think it's important to have a space for people (especially as these posts seem to be primarily written by young folks) to do these things, but we are not quite sure if /r/Bropill is or should be the space for this kind of content.

&amp;#x200B;

So we are asking the community: 

\*Should we as mods start removing some of the more

negative content on here? 

\*Or perhaps we should just encourage the posting of positive memes and content more? 

\*What are your thoughts on the state of the sub in general? Feel free to use this thread as a meta discussion place.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally we are looking for more mods, as currently a lot of the workload of moderating this is just handled by very few users who are quite overwhelmed. If you have are an active poster of the sub and want to help out, feel free to send us a modmail with an application!\`",bropill,1607949937,selib,13,1,True,2020-12-14
2020 has been a messy and dark year of introspection for this disabled bro,"2020 has been a total mess bros, kind of lost control

I'm physically disabled and that comes with many issues, but not what you might expect. Firstly Covid has meant I've been under the strictest of lockdowns because an awful lot of the people dying from this virus are disabled in some way, although this has gone unreported by mainstream news for some reason.

This has been the least of my problems this year though. Lockdown made me deeply introspective about my stance as an anti-sjw and caused me to read about stuff I'd dismissed for so long. I read about rape culture and recognised that I felt so desperate in Uni that I could have easily have contributed. I also realised that my best friends - 2 of my Uni carers - were both sex offenders, leading me to dump them both in the same week after 6 years of close relationship. 

In my experience everyone treats you as asexual if you use a wheelchair, and so nobody talked to me at all about sex growing up apart from my dodgy carers. This applies to my overprotective parents who I live with, who got very upset at me when I started expressing new progressive beliefs with them. They automatically assumed that I had been brainwashed, rather than coming to my own independent conclusions. I think a big reason for this response is they still view me as a child, so when it comes to big topics they assume I'm unable to understand.

I know that they'd freak out if I ever wanted to protest about something. I'd also rather bang my head against a hot grill than talk to them about my repressed sexual desires. I've given up on the hope of finding a girlfriend, because just the thought of talking about the idea makes me embarrassed. As for friends, I don't have any left. The only people who give me the time are my carers because it's their job, and I'm tired of relying on carers for friendships (the relationship never ends well after they quit or you fire them.)

So here I am, 30 years old and wondering where my life is going. My parents don't take my opinions seriously and I feel society wants to brush me under the carpet. I'm lucky in that I'm financially secure, but otherwise things feel slightly hopeless.

After dropping the anti-sjw label I felt guilt-ridden and so I joined 2 charities on a whim, partly with the theory that if I met and knew a more diverse range of people I would gain some sense of belonging in the world, but now I'm involved I'm experiencing huge doubts in my abilities. It's also difficult trying to build new connections over Zoom and email.

I have been seeing therapists throughout the year which has helped, but it's hard coming to terms with how corrupt the world is after such a sheltered upbringing and viewing the world through the lens of popular anti-sjws, i.e. nihilism and ignorance. 

I love this sub but couldn't find many posts about the experience of having a visible disability so I thought I'd pop it in here for your consideration. Mainstream media tends to portray disability as the problem which we are expected to somehow 'overcome', but in my opinion the real issue is the way we are viewed (or hidden) in society and the lack of accurate representation in the media. If you'd like an example check out [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxrS7-I_sMQ)on 'inspiration porn'.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. For any asexual bros who might be reading, keep doing you: there's nothing wrong with being asexual, it's just when you're het and physically disabled it's extremely hard to convince yourself that you're attractive when you are viewed and treated like a child by the majority of the people you meet (especially when they're the same age as you!)",bropill,1607959931,annguy123,5,1,True,2020-12-14

I'm slowly becoming more social,"For the past few days I've noticed I'm becoming a bit more social.

I'm in college and I generally stay in the dorms. I have a roommate and we've become pretty good friends. We often fuck around and one of the jokes I make is when people pass by our door, I yell and sound like I smoke a pack a day (I don't actually smoke). A couple girls have noticed this and started meowing at our door and today I actually talked to them. It was honestly very fun and I feel so good that I'm talking to people I don't know, especially girls.

In college, when I go to the seminaries and labs, there's this other girl that I started talking to. It was my first non-forced social interaction with someone in a long time. She's a bit older than me, has a job and can't come all that often, but she's very nice.

The reason I'm especially happy that I'm talking to girls I never met before is my ex girlfriend actually made me scared of most other girls. 

I'm also getting along really well with my roommate, although it was forced at first, now we're pretty good friends.

I am also seeing a therapist now and she's helping too.

Bro's do i miss out on things when i don't give in to peer preassure?,"Hi bros it's nearly midnight while i am writing this text and i thought about some stuff in the last 2 hours.
At the moment i have a part time job and tommorow i want to quit because this job is soul crushing and in
evenings like this i am so exhausted that i dont even want to put in some work on my hobbies and passions.
And in the last months while working i realized that i have maybe two friends i talk to and even with them i am only maybe every two weeks in contact with.

Then i asked myself why do i have so few social contacts and i think a big thing is that i don't drink or smoke.
I don't utilize any drugs because i just never had the urge to use them and i think the risk you can be for yourself and people arround you can be problematic if you over do it.

I got a invited to some parties and some gathering where the main focus is to drink until you black out. I don't judge this behaviour and i think if it makes you happy then go on but it aint my cup of tee.

But now in my early twenties i feel like that the train for making new friends is gone and this gnawing feeling of regret dosen't stop telling me that i should have just heared to the people arround me and get drunk or high just for the sake of making connections.

However, I’m really unsure what I want to do with my life. I went into my undergrad thinking that I would eventually move on to a PhD program, but now that I’ve made it here I’m completely unsure if I want to do that.

It depressed me, I’ve loved learning, tutoring, and teaching my whole life. Then I thought about teaching high school. Something that my friends and family have always said they could see me doing.

That combined with a crazy religious mother not letting me go anywhere outside of school has left me feeling socially inept. Now as an adult I started college online because I couldn't handle being on campus (and I don't have a car to get there anyways). I have a few friends at work but monday through Friday I'm alone at home not talking to anyone. 

I've only had 2 girlfriends; one at 18 in highschool, and another at 19 who I technically lost my virginity to.....they both cheated on me. Before that I was a lonely loser who constantly got rejected, now a year later I'm back to that, and a girl I asked out on Saturday is more than likely standing me up. I asked her if she wanted to go on a date with me and she, ""not right now."" She did however give me her number and she actually initiated conversations with me and genuinely looked like she wanted to get to know me.....no response to my text message.

Meanwhile all of my friends are in these happy, longterm relationships and I can't even play video games with them peacefully. I'm not trying to be mean, but hearing my buddy and his gf talk about all the sex they have and how much they love each other is overwhelming when I can't even get a date. And my cheating ex gf? She's with the guy she cheated on me with and pregnant with his kid.

I've never felt so undesirable and worthless before. I'm in therapy and I've been trying to numb the pain with video games but it isn't working. I just got the new series x and my preorder copy of cyberpunk....the game is sitting in it's box because I don't have the energy to play it.

I can't accept that I will die a virgin/Unloved,"I try my best not to think about it but it's too hard. Everything reminds me of how lonely I am and sometimes I can't take the pain. I don't want to live unloved and uncared for. I'm 19 now and turning 20 in 5 months. It's a shame that I'm a virgin and people online told me it's a damn shame.

I can't accept the fact that I will always be a virgin and most likely will never even get a girl to be interested in me. I don't deserve a girlfriend, I'm too ugly black and fat, I don't deserve to be happy. I was put on earth to suffer and be another statistic. I'm going to die alone it's hard to accept.

Advice from someone who has been in a similar situation/has been cheated on..,[removed],bropill,1608110971,i-like-peonys,0,1,True,2020-12-16
I would really like some advice and help,"LONG POST: NSFW - CW/TW: Sex, Nudes, Suicidal thoughts, anxiety/OCD

Hi, this post is express my guilt and to ask for advice moving forward.

Tl;dr: 
I used to catfish people on Grindr involving sexting and sharing nudes (the nudes were the real me, the face pics were not mine). I deleted all catfishing accounts/photos/chats. What should I do now? What steps can I take to try make things right/better?

The Full Story (long)

Context:

I am in my early 20s, I am gay and was raised very Christian. I was bullied in high school because of being gay. I have a good group of supportive friends. I suffer from OCD symptoms and have been diagnosed with anxiety. I am also a catfish.

The Backstory:

In the summer of 2019 (when I was 19) until about 3 months ago (aged 20) I used a fake profile to talk to men on Grindr (a gay chat/hook up app). The vast majority of these chats were of a sexual nature (essentially arranging hook ups that I had no actual intention of going to, exchanging nudes and sexting). I used a fake name and a face photo from the internet but the nudes were mine. 

Every few months over the course of the last year or so, I would go through a period of like a week where I would have these conversations with men on Grindr. I would block all of them, often without warning. I never said that the face pic was not mine. Sometimes if they asked for a Snapchat I would give them a fake one I had made and we would swap nudes and talk there. I’ve probably talked to like 100 boys in this fake Grindr profile. The longest I talked to someone was probably around a week. 

When I was doing it, I never considered that I was actually catfishing. I didn’t intend to cause harm or go into it with the intent of getting nudes to expose anyone or be malicious with the conversations. I never shared the nudes I received, often didn’t even save the photos or screenshot the chats. 

My Realisation:

In September, I decided to stop using Grindr. But then a few weeks ago, I really realised what I had actually been doing on Grindr. I had been deceiving people - catfishing them - often in a sexual manner. I now realise how incredibly wrong and disgusting my actions are. Not only did I waste people’s time, have them share things with me they might not have shared if I used my actual face pics but I also left them abruptly when they might have been developing some sort of actual connection with ‘me’ (my catfish persona) on Grindr. 

This has left me with a lot of guilt, stress and disappointment with myself.  I’m so mad at myself for doing something so vile and deceitful. It doesn’t matter that I didn’t intend to hurt anyone because the harm was in my lying - my acts were harmful and my intentions don’t change that. I feel like a predator and a creep, and I don’t feel like I deserve a future or to enjoy happy things anymore because of what I’ve done. I feel guilty that my friends still hang out with me and my family still talks to me because they don’t know what a shitty person I actually am. 

Advice Needed:

This where I would like some advice. I deleted all the chats, photos and accounts that I used for catfishing in a guilt-ridden, stress-fuelled rampage. But now I wish I could actually apologise to these people. I cannot hope to ever apologise to all of the people because there are so many of them, I don’t remember who they all are and they are also spread all over my country (since I did this while on holiday sometimes). 

Do you guys think I should create a new Grindr account to attempt to find at least some of these people and apologise to them? Or will this cause more hurt - especially if the people didn’t suspect I was a catfish and also because it’s many months (a year in some cases) since I last talked to these people. How else can I get closure from this? No ever told me they were hurt, but the idea that someone was hurt by my actions is deeply troubling to me. 

I’m also going to get help from a therapist of some kind because this has really affected how I view myself and I have been suicidal over this (please don’t be sympathetic - I know the focus should be on my victims). 

I want to move forward from this and starting making a more positive contribution to society but I feel like I don’t deserve to do that. No one in my real life knows about this and I’m just constantly consumed by guilt and worrying about the people I talked to on this fake profile. 

Closing Thoughts - to Catfishers and Catfish victims:

I will never be doing this toxic, disgusting shit again. I want to be a better person in the future but I know that cannot change what I’ve done in the past. To anyone catfishing right now - stop. Please just stop, apologise to your victims and seek help. You’re hurting yourself in ways you might not realise right now, but more importantly - you’re hurting innocent people. You’re still hurting people even if you don’t intend to cause harm - trust me, I know. 

To catfish victims - I am very sorry. I realise now how hurtful the actions of people like me are. You do not deserve to be lied to and violated. You have done nothing wrong and the guilt and shame lies only with the people who catfished you. I hope you are able to heal from what happened to you.",bropill,1608147496,sadthrowaway0001,9,1,True,2020-12-16

Bros pamper yourselves,"I've been feeling a little depressed and schlubby the last few months. I've put on a bit of weight like a lot of people so I'll forgive myself that. It's hard and stressful times but I've been feeling so undesirable in my skin and my confidence has taken a hit.

I decided to take some small steps and look after myself a bit better, it's tough to get out to the gym (not that that was ever my thing) and dieting is a big commitment right now. I started with something small, buying a nice loofah and an exfoliating body wash and just chilling out in the shower for a while, really slow it down rather than rushing throught the motions of getting clean and ready like usual. Kinda meditative. 

My thought was kinda inspired by those scenes in comedies where the dude gets roped into a spa day or something and ends up loving it. It's played for laughs because its sooo feminine I guess but surprise surprise being pampered feels amazing.

I ended up really getting into it and bought a pumice stone and a bunch of nice scented hair stuff. Even lit some candles. Then I walked around the cologne counter at the mall. Bros let me tell you it is **nice** to just focus on yourself and your appearance for a bit. I found some really nice colognes with the help of the staff and feel sexy for the first time all year.

How Do I Find Friends?,"In part I'm using this post as a journaling exercise to get myself to admit certain truths... so to a certain extent this post is addressed to myself... thanks to the more patient among you...

My friend-finding skills have been awful. I always end up doing what I did in high school - seeking out the desperately lonely and inviting them over to our table for lunch. As a high school student, that's very sweet and builds a big group of fascinating introverted friends. 

But as a 45 year old man that is an absolutely terrible way to bring people into my life.

The people who really want to be a part of my life tend to be... Maladjusted. And you know what? That's not on them. I'm the one who reflexively reaches out to someone as soon as I perceive them as lonely, shy, or somehow hurting... and again, when I was younger, good habit, but now...

Now I worry about how safe it is for some of these guys to know where my daughter sleeps. I mean I've racked up a murderer, a worst dad in history (cut out the details), and a career drug dealer among others...

So switch up your focus dude.

They say: show me your 5 closest friends and I'll tell you your future. So... What do I want my future to be?

I want to be a film maker. Indie writer/director.

Great. So. In my suburban town, without ditching my whole career, how do I find ways to spend times with people who work in film?

Do I... Find cameramen and writers in my area and offer to take them out for coffee to pick their brains? I mean I legit do have questions... So maybe that's a start... Or maybe that's crass.

I feel like I can’t (properly) cope with my depression.,"[Note: although the title says that I “can’t cope”, I have no intention of seriously injuring myself, though this rant does mention the topic so please proceed with caution.]

I’ve [15M] been depressed since I was young and whatnot, no real cause but it’s been there for several years. I don’t think a long backstory is necessary — in short, I have had clinical depression since I was 10 or so, and it varies between mild and extreme. Recently, my depression has been worsening. I was taken off my antidepressants and the mood changes are very noticeable. Even a question or someone speaking to me can set me off, and I will begin yelling, in a very angry tone which basically screams “shut up.” It’s not kind of me, and I feel bad every time, but I’m uncontrollably unstable, helplessly angry and I’m stuck without a therapist until school begins yet again. I’m much more emotional now, and not in a good way. Only my negative emotions have become more easily triggered, I’ve developed the typical “loss of interest in hobbies/activities” and honestly don’t care for much these days. I sound like I’m devoid of emotions towards others, and to an extent, I feel like I am. I’m caught in a terrible rut and what you want me to do is to... fixate my time on other people? What a joke, when those exact same people do absolutely nothing to help me, or completely dismiss my mental illnesses. I have my reasons for struggling to get a doctor’s appointment, since I’m aware of the incoming “speak to your doctor” comments. I have tried, I’m not completely clueless despite my anger, but trying to have a confidential conversation with a doctor when you are unable to go there physically and also would be easily overheard over the phone is quite the challenge. I don’t know how to cope with the overwhelming anger, the constant crying, the sheer irritability and lack of respect towards others, the severe suicidal thoughts that haunt me at night, the inability to go to sleep, the thoughts in my brain suggesting that suicide is the way out, the impulses to engage in self-destructive behaviours. I’m completely lost and all people around me will care about is my academic performance or how I’m of use to them and their own issues. What a harsh situation I’ve found myself in. And I know you all to be good and well-intentioned people, so... help a severely depressed and emotionally troubled brother out?",bropill,1608248868,wellfuckmylife666,2,3,True,2020-12-17

Make sure to focus on your self care bros,"So I'm going to therapy. I'm doing this to make sure that I am OK and there isn't anything going on in my head that I am not aware of.

I recently had a friend get out of an abusive relationship and saw first hand just how much that type of manipulation can affect a person.

Its been 10 years since I got out of my own 5 year long abusive relationship. One that I did not recognize as abusive until yeats later... but even then I took the effects of that abuse into future relationships without realizing it. I've done better and gotten a grip on what has happened to me through self reflection and talking with friends... so I think I'm over it?

But what worries me has been the conversations I have had with my friend _after_ she has gone through therapy and realized she had been abused. It was still a struggle for her to understand the lies and guilt tripping that went on wasn't her fault.

For me I worry I have little land mines in my head that I may not be aware of having never really confronted any of this stuff directly. 

I am happy now and am doing ok, but I want to make sure, and to make sure I can be a better person for those around me.

For those bros who may not know the signs of abuse, I want to at least link to a source below.

I did that like a month and a half ago but i wish i had done it way earlier. I was with her earlier and we were talking bout sex then the convo turned and we started talking bout real shit. She told me she gonna do something and move. I think after christmas and that shit hurt. She saying that she i can come visit or she visit me but i don’t know if that will happen or not.

"Bros, is it normal to feel like you had your childhood robbed from you?","Hey bros, first time posting in this subreddit, hope you're all doing okay. I'm a 16 year old trans woman that will hopefully be transitioning soon, and lately i've been thinking about how I feel so strongly like I had my childhood robbed from me. Not just because I grew up as the wrong gender, but socially I was very deprived. My parents were very strict and tried to keep me in a bubble growing up, so I never got to spend time with my friends outside of school or even keep contact with them. As a result I never made any meaningful friendships, combined with the fact that i've already moved school districts and cities three times in my life, means i've had to abandon a lot of people I had connections with. Now i'm in high school and have a small circle of friends, but they're pretty close-minded, they unironically believe 5g causes cancer and the like, and while they fully accept me and gender me correctly they are just so stubborn and full of themselves and I don't feel like I have any real friends in real life. To make matters worse, I live and go to school in a very small christian town with a total population of 1300 people, and everyone's really nice on the outside but it's kinda superficial, and being a nerdy kind of gal with a knack for engineering, it's hard to find people to really connect with since most of these people have the ""graduate, get job, get married, have kids, and die"" mentality and don't really care about making a difference in the world. Not saying that's a bad thing, it's just not my way of thinking. I wanna do something significant with my life. I'm a junior, which means I have one more year of school after this one until I graduate and can get out of this town, and I wanna make that year special and meaningful. Recently, my mother, who I am out to and she supports me 100%, proposed that I could live with my wealthy dad in the city (my parents are split up, dad lives in the city while I live with my mom and stepdad in nowheresville) and that means I could go to an inner city school, which sounds very exciting considering the school would be bigger and I would have a lot more opportunities to make friends and memories. While I may not have been able to make good memories in childhood, maybe I can still make good memories at another new school in my last year of school. Which brings me to the point of this post: should I go through with it, and move in with my dad and go to a city school? It just seems like a big risk to take, and idk how it will play out.

Struggling to find a purpose in life,"Hi guys, I’m a 20yo guy, and I struggle to find a purpose in my life. Part of that has to do with my extremely pessimistic views of the future, so I don’t really know what to do. Because of my pessimistic views (and just generally not being interested), I really don’t want to be a father, so I don’t see that as a purpose in life (provided I could even find someone to have children with). I don’t foresee myself really being anyone’s “soulmate” or anything like that; I’m not really physically attractive (super short), and my personality is kinda meh. To be clear, I’m not a stereotypical incel. I don’t have any animosity towards women, and if they don’t find me attractive, that’s fine. I’ve made it this far in life without romantic love, so what’s another 20+ years? That said, if someone who I feel attracted to likes me, I’m not gonna say no. So if I’m not meant for love or fatherhood, what do I think I’m meant for? All I feel I really have left is political ideology. But, given my extremely pessimistic views, I don’t even think that is my purpose. I’m pretty sure I’ll just end up trying to have a fun life while I can.

"Redefining ""self-care""","I think it's important to change our thinking about what self-care means. It's easy to eat pizza or a big burger, watch a movie instead of doing work, and ""splurge."" These things feel good while we're doing them, for a moment. But afterwards, we feel greasy and fat, we feel shame at not having made progress toward our goals, and we worry about money. Instead of focusing on pursuing addictive, short-term feelings, we should train ourselves to desire a long-term feeling of well-being. People need to change the way they think about exercise, from thinking of it as a chore, to thinking about to how good it will feel to pursue their ideal physique, have good health, be strong, and have higher self-esteem. When thinking about eating junk food, it's important to think about how bad you will feel afterward, instead of how good it will taste. Then focus on how good something healthy will taste, like sashimi, and how energetic it will make you feel. It's important to consider what's more valuable, and what will bring more happiness: watching another quirky video on YouTube, or learning a new skill. Watching some Hollywood movie, or accomplishing something you've been putting off. Self-discipline doesn't have to feel like punishment or avoiding the things we want. We can change the things we want, reprogram our minds, and instill new habits and desires that are in accordance with what we really want for ourselves. Of course, changing our habits can be uncomfortable, and pursuing what we want takes a little more effort than consuming easy, addictive things. We have to get in the mindset of taking charge and pushing through that tiny bit of discomfort, in order to get what we want and feel really good. But the more we practice doing what's really best, the easier and more natural it becomes, because we strengthen those habits and their neural pathways, while weakening the ones we stop feeding. Epicureanism provides a decent framework for a lot of this.",bropill,1608314591,sXepicurezen,1,4,True,2020-12-18
"I feel undesired but it doesn’t make sense, I guess","I am a 21-year-old guy and I have never been in a relationship. I feel sort of undesired because of that, like nobody wants me. The thing is, I know that some girls had crushes on me in school and one even asked me out. So, feeling undesired makes little sense, I guess, but if that is the case, then I don’t know what this feeling is. Just plain old loneliness? Maybe it is just the fear that I’ll never find somebody (yes, I know, I am only 21), but I feel like I am missing out on so much.


I am already balding like crazy, it started when I was around 17, and I feel incredibly anxious around people. I think that has actually gotten worse since my last year at school and now at university, which sucks considering that confidence is so important when it comes to pretty much anything, especially dating. Every time I hear that confidence is the most important factor in dating it makes me feel even worse. I started seeing a psychologist from my university during the summer in person, but stopped because corona got worse in my country. I hope that I’ll be able to recommence my sessions soon.


I am really happy for my best friend, she has been in a relationship with her boyfriend for two years now, but I can’t help but feel a tinge of envy as well. The same goes for another really close friend, he has been in relationship for half a year or so and I feel happy for them, but again, also quite envious. When I see couples in the street, I feel incredibly happy, it is so nice to see people in love, it really is beautiful. During the summer I saw that our neighbours down the road had a small gathering, turns out they got married! I was actually jumping for joy when I saw them, him in his suit and her in her wedding dress, taking pictures on our street. I am a sucker for weddings and all that stuff. However, I think that might not be for long anymore. I dread the day my first reaction to seeing a happy couple is resentment or envy. 


I don’t like online dating and with corona I have no other way to get to know people. If I am very lucky, I will find somebody by the time I am, say, 23, and even that is optimistic. Since corona started, I have these phases during which my mental health just takes a nosedive. I hope this particular phase won’t be as long as others, but even when I am not in one of these phases I don’t feel great. I have made a lot of progress over the past year, I have been working on myself considerably, but it feels like corona is inhibiting my growth. 


Sorry if this was a little rambly. I feel a sense of shame writing this out, it feels very raw and like I pity myself too much. Thanks for reading.",bropill,1608324506,Orioram,6,6,True,2020-12-18

Am I overreacting and overthinking?,"I don't know if media has this bias, but why is everything treated like a commodity? With everything going on, I feel like just a number with no significance. 

Like let's say friendship. Though I have some meaningful friendships, it's not like they're gonna last forever. I am still in college and I don't think we will be in same city or even country after graduating. I feel most friendships have become superficial and lack any real connection. It feels like I'm just someone's contact and just a number.

Even relationships are treated like a commodity. How hot is your b/gf. How many people you slept with and all that. Now I'm not saying that casual sex or relationships are not bad, but I don't know anyone of my age take things seriously. I have a little traditional mindset such that I desire to be monogamous and probably get married. But I feel sex is seen as an achievement and everyone is behind showing how much you have sex rather than real connection. Again, this might be social media/media bias. Like am I just a number?

I don't feel safe or connected. It feels like I am lagging behind and not being as modern as others are. I don't want to feel a void. I always felt some kind of void and wanted some real connection. But from everything I see around, superficial relationships are being rewarded. And being honest, I am unable to trust people by seeing how much they normalize narcissism. I feel faintly safe now because my friends aren't that much of jerks, but my high school was full of such people and I am afraid, once I get a job and move to a different city, I'll be all lonely. Sometimes I question myself if I should become narcissistic. But I can never be. I cannot do things done to me in high school to others. Or things I am afraid of happening again in the future. 

People are admiring textbook narcissists and they are the ones being rewarded and getting along in life, for example, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, or even Donald Trump. I don't know if internet has that bias, but I feel people are becoming extremely selfish, lacking empathy and finding justification for it. I don't know if I am being cynical or this is reality. I want to see the positive side by knowing that my friends would never be like that. Or some people around me who are honest and empathetic in general. But I think we have too much selfishness going around. Like see how normalized cheating is. Now there are people who are poly, but they're not for me. I feel no connection in such an arrangement. Like I feel bad that I am not having the values of my generation (like casual sex or polygamy; winning even if it is at expense of others), but at the same time my conscience does not allow me to be that way. I need some strong deep connection that I never had, even with my parents. And I feel like I am asking too much.

In 20 (almost 21) years of my life, I felt some void. I wanted to belong and feel connected. It did not happen in school. It is kind of happening in college. But again, I don't know if these friendships continue long after graduating. And I feel to be truly connected and trust someone to sleep with them, because every time I was vulnerable, I was ridiculed. And being overweight with stretch marks and a smaller manhood just makes insecurities too much. 

I have a few questions 
1. Am I overthinking this?
2. Am I overreacting?
3. Am I being unreasonable?
4. Am I being selfish?
5. Am I being a kind of misogynist and judgemental?",bropill,1608415967,sayinedi,4,1,True,2020-12-19
I need validation for my trauma (tw abuse),"In order to give appropriate context for this incident I need to establish two things:
1) At the time I was at a small school that accidentally became a cult. I was on guard 24/7, I could not trust anyone.
2) I am autistic and hate being touched, even by my mom lol

I was walking with my school to the local park, and I was talking with a friend while waiting at a crosswalk. The little man showed up telling us to go and my biology teacher pushed the small of my back in order to get me to move foreword. As soon as it happened I felt so violated. My mind immediately jumped to the worst conclusion and it felt like I had been intentionally groped. 
Of course I knew that it was just a reflex on his part, having a small child and all, but even now, four years later, I can still feel his hand and it makes me want to throw up. For years I was so afraid to relate to the feelings of sexual abuse survivors because my experience was so small. And he didn’t even mean to hurt me.

Back into the dating fray but very insecure about being out of it for more than half a decade](https://www.reddit.com/r/bropill/comments/jrtw0o/hey_bros_back_into_the_dating_fray_but_very/).

Before going into it, I've got to thank to everyone that responded to the above thread, you are true bros. Also, this is going to be a vent thread, because I don't think there is not other thing to do but to be chill and myself and hope for the best, but I'm always open to ideas regarding my situation.

And when I say a vent thread, I mean a place to write down what I'm feeling, I feel like that maybe healthy, also my therapist has gone on holiday, so there goes my outlet to vent my anxiety, also i feel like I burned all my friends with my emotional bullshit and don't want to really vomit my emotions on them again, I mean, that was one of the reasons I got into therapy, to have somewhere safe to vent and not burden to people around me with it. 

So, on with the show: 

All went well, better than I expected, better than my wildest expectations, I mean the only problem I had was the obvious effects of literally seven years (I lost the fear of doing math and found out when last I had had sex) of masturbating with an iron grip and had a bit of problem staying hard, but she was very understanding, and I was very honest about it. Also, I found out that eating pussy and being very enthusiastic about everything is never old and you don't unlearn it, so that part was very successful, as in we spent a significant part of the weekend in happily bed, and not the crazy problem I thought it would be. Anyways, I started looking and implementing into ways of deprograming my dick of needing so much manual abuse to work properly, so I also think that next time we're together I'll be even better and more confident.

But now a week after a very, very good weekend spent together, another problem looms in my mind: How to keep the good feelings going through what seems to be in all but name another lockdown (I'm in a tier 4 area) and not go crazy or seem too needy. I have this constant image of her leaving / ignoring / telling me to fuck off suddenly. I mean, my therapist highlighted me that it's not illogical to have that fear, as that has been the story of my life in terms of relationships from the cradle, as in my mom was very withholding emotionally and most of my romantic relationships where somewhat a mirror of that, of my having to beg for love and reassurance, and how that is never good as it usually as the opposite effect. I mean, this girl has never given me reasons to have to beg, quite the contrary, but every once in a while I get that anxiety. At the end of it, it's also a deep fear of fucking thing up, both because its been a while and because it's so good, anxiety notwithstanding.

And when I say anxiety notwithstanding, I mean it. If I wasn't having anxiety about this, I would fixate on another thing.

Anyways, vent off for now and sorry for the stream of consciousness rant.

TLDR: Things are good, and I don't know how to deal with good because I good was never on the plate for me, at least for long.",bropill,1608490844,FlavioLikesToDrum,7,1,True,2020-12-20
Hey there bros. I need some advice on what to do with my life.,"So here is the gist of it. I'm 22 and currently studying psychology (second year). I already switched from electrical engineering (spent a semester there). Basically I picked EE because of good job opportunity even do I didn't like math and physics (yeah I know not the best move) and I was a great student and thought I could power through it. I got depressed and begged my parents to switch to something more close to humanities. My favorite classes in high school were in order history, literature, philosophy and sociology (I did very well in all of these and often did a lot of extra curriculum projects) while psychology didn't leave a mark on me as much. I decided to switch to psychology because I was still worried about my finances (In my country therapists can make a decent living and people have started to open up more to the idea so it was an ok plan for the future) and the idea of being a therapist seemed great because I love helping people.

Now here I am still dissatisfied with my choice. The change was certainly a step in the right direction but I am barely making it through and often miss deadlines (the covid breakout made all the professors lax and let me turn stuff in at a later date). I don't know if I just became lazy or is it just not for me. My mom said she hated university (she studied economics because her father made her do it) but she is satisfied with her job now so she recommends that I power through it. Idk if therapy training will be more interesting for me (to a certain extent probably yes but I don't know if it will be enough). I have also changed my mind on education and find that it shouldn't be for job training but for the sake of learning itself.

I was thinking of switching to history next year. But I'm worried I'm just a lazy, selfish, spoiled bum and I will be unhappy again (even do I love watching history documentaries and reading about many different periods). I also feel ashamed that my generation of high school friends will son be finishing up with their studies and I will be just starting again for the third time.

My questions are:

Is my mom right? Should I just power through or should I switch to history?

I hate this country,"Disclaimer that I don’t wanna argue politics or whatever in the comments. I’m just very sad and angry about something that happens to be political if that makes sense. No need to read I just need to put this somewhere, sorry in advance. 

I hate this fucking country. I hate how we have formed an empire and let people starve within its gilded borders. I hate that you can work one, two, three jobs and still be poor, despite the “unskilled” laborer being the force that generates the wealth people simp over CEOs for. I hate my neighbor who flys the American flag and works for the military and sees nothing wrong with bombing weddings in Yemen if there’s a chance at taking out a terrorist at the same time, I hate seeing his sweet kid and knowing he’s probably gonna grow up to distrust me based on the color of my skin in a few years just like his da. I hate the educational system I work for bc although I love each and every one of my students to death, in science I have to teach them about the fucking mitochondria instead of how to start a community garden to feed their homeless neighbors and their under nourished siblings, or about how climate change is preventable but bc the capitalists who fund our democracy find it profits more valuable than their lives they’ll never be able to safely raise kids of their own. I hate that my parents who deserve so much have to work so, so hard, but I also hate their internalized grind culture, and the idea that you have to earn money to deserve an equally good education or life a richer person can get. I hate that my brother, with such a sweet heart and so much patience values status so much he wants to work on Wall Street, knowing the issues it causes, and I hate that I cannot explain the dangers of pursing wealth like this without hurting his feelings, or dampening his dreams and world view.

I hate that I am no longer the person I was, and can never be him again, complete and with other interests before I found out how awful this country is, capitalism is. I hate that I was never even taught that there are other, fairer ways to govern or run economies not in public schools or college, or graduate school, and I hate that it took a pandemic, nationwide protests, and fucking Instagram memes to educate me about what the system I live and participate in is really like. I hate that the advocacy work I do is never enough, i hate the politicians that tell me not to speak, protest, riot, when they do not listen, I hate the cops that smile at me, old enough to know what systems they enforce, I hate my town, from the racists to the liberals bc they are older and should be familiar with the inequities of ours system but either don’t or just aren’t bothered by it, and I hate hate hate being filled with so much anger everyday, at the injustice, the completely utterly avoidable injustice of this world on top of everything else that’s wrong with me, and I hate that most everyone else isn’t just as angry all the time.

Feeling absolutely worthless...,"So, I can't really remember how I got there, I just know that I ended up on a random post from a certain ""female dating"" subreddit, that was talking about how it's pointless and worthless to date a man who struggles severely with mental health issues.

Here's the thing; I get that when you don't have your shit together at all, you shouldn't be looking for a partner. I'm a fucking mess. I have no job, my mental health is in shambles, I'll also never likely make a middle class salary. I've been in relationships, but it's been almost 3 years since my last one, mostly for personal reasons. But after browsing that sub (I know I shouldn't have) and seeing women talking about how men with mental health issues are burdens (even if they get help), and how men below a certain salary are ""low value"", I'm sort of (actually just full on) having a crushing depressive bout. I've been trying to better myself the past few years, but the chaos of this year led me to have a complete mental breakdown, which led to my first hospitalization.

Now, I can't help but feel like I could never be good enough. I don't want to have some billionaire's job, I just want to live comfortably and hopefully make music for a living someday. Not music that will make me rich and famous, but will certainly pay the bills. I can never guarantee that I won't have breakdowns, even after I get all the mental help in the world. I will have panic attacks, weeks where I cry more often, that's what even well-managed mental health issues look like. It will never go away completely. So because of all this, am I worthless to a potential partner? I feel stupid for asking, because I've dated women who prove this wrong. But I can't help it, seeing the absolutely awful things being said about mentally unstable men, it's just playing back in my head now.

I'll probably delete this post later, but I really need some motivation and reassurance right now, that I don't have to be a perfectly adjusted, neurotypical, middle class man to have a successful relationship. It feels crazy for me to even type that, because I've always been confident and supportive in my relationships, despite being a wreck most of the time. This is the first time I've ever felt these sorts of feelings of unworthiness. As said I could just use some reassurance. Thank you for taking the time to read bros.

"Hey Bros, thanks for being here","As someone who was skeptical about being part of this community because it was lefty (I'm way better than that now), you guys have helped out so much.

This community is important and a need for men, women and enbys to be able to talk about what they're feeling and know that things are going to be okay.

I'm a better person than I was 2 years ago and I've got to thank you guys.

I've made friends and talked with people old me would have avoided for prejudice.  I've gotten my confidence back and lost weight.  I know I'm on the right track.

So guys on this day of remembrance and thanks (please though, dont forget about the American Indians), thanks for being their bros.

You guys inspire me to do better.",bropill,1606422424,MiracleAlien,14,1,True,2020-11-26
Weekly r/BroPill vibe check!,Hey bros! It's time for your weekly vibe check. How are you doing? Anything you're struggling with? Would you like to share an achievement with us?,bropill,1606429478,AutoModerator,19,1,True,2020-11-26
A humble message: We've been taught to obsess over self-improvement. It's time for some self-acceptance,"We are afraid to accept ourselves. We're terrified that we will be stuck being us for the rest of our lives. And you don't have to look far for evidence. Each year billions are spent on self-improvement products, books, gizmos, classes, sometimes even pills. Self-improvement dominates discussions of several online spaces. Entire areas of this website are driven towards delivering bite-size content meant to let you psych yourself up to help you block out the terrifying reality that you are *you,* you will be *you* for as long as you live. You will always have been born into the circumstances you were born into, every thing you see and hear will be processed by the soggy wad of bubblegum bouncing around your noggin. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you put it that way, it's not hard to sympathize with such broad and desperate efforts to bury this truth. But the more we ignore it, the more we hurt ourselves. We try to break the immutable laws of reality, but they break us instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, some of you have stopped reading, and are getting ready to fight with all the voracity at your disposal. **What in the hell is this guy even talking about?,** you must be thinking. **If self-improvement is a big illusion to keep us from facing the grim reality, what even is the point?** 

&amp;#x200B;

The point is to make friends with yourself, your body, your mind, your abilities, your circumstances. Make friends with the truth. Make them your allies. Of course you can still go to the gym. Of course you can still study new topics. Of course you can try to make it under our harsh, unforgiving system.

 

But no matter what you do on that journey, you will be stuck with yourself for a traveling companion. So you may as well make an ally of yourself. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to go to the gym, don't use hatred of your body to motivate yourself. After all, who are you going to the gym for? To be less offensive to the eyes of others? That won't take you far; other people don't care that much. To have better luck in romance? If you've made yourself into an enemy, that self will sabotage you everywhere it can. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't go to the gym because you can't stand your body; go to the gym because you love your body. Your body wants to move. Moving is joyful! Moving is beautiful! Not only that, it's a privilege. If you make an enemy of yourself, you won't have the joy of movement. Exercise will be a punishment. And punishments are much easier to cut out of your life than joy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Making an ally of yourself helps with romance too. When you're at ease with yourself, it's so much easier to be at ease with others. So romance as a means of ""self-improvement"" is self-evidently self-defeating. If you absorb the idea that you can't be okay until you have romance, you set your own trap. Once again, yourself, the enemy, has led a brilliant sabotage. But an ally-self will help you graciously brush off rejection, take chances, move elegantly and naturally and joyously through the dance of relationships. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have a powerful potential ally in yourself. Part of building that allyship is accepting that that self you've been running away from will always be there. Accepting this doesn't mean giving up on goals, it doesn't mean acquiescing to your current external circumstances, but instead performing a deep personal investigation into what truly is and is not part of *you.*

So after a long sad days I'm finally feeling good and I feel like sharing kindness and positive vibes to those who need it. It's always been my dream to help and inspire people and I sometimes try to do this on reddit with uplifting posts. And sadly I sometimes come across people who disagree with my positive message, which wouldn't be a problem but they also attack me or insult me ,telling me that I don't care about people in reality and I am an attention seeker / karma whore if you know what I mean. And ofc, that's not true, I really want to brighten up someone's days and inspire them, even if I did hunt for karma that doesn't give anyone the right to just insult me ,cause it's my life and I do what I want.

"Completely tying my entire self esteem/worth to the fact that I'm almost 22, never had a girlfriend/sex, socially inept, and behind everyone else who developed normal friendships &amp; milestones. Insense feelings of ""wasting my youth"" has put me in the ""it's over."" mindset. Please help me.","To make a long story short:
&gt;Feeling ok about myself
&gt;Checks social media/I look around me
&gt;Everyone else is attractive and having sex/relationships u ugly virgin lol
&gt;Everyone your age has friends, experiences, and a social life while no one knows you exist.
&gt;Realizing you made it to 22 and have done nothing, wasted your youth, and are incapable of being normal, loved, and happy.
&gt;it's over.
&gt;Feeling very bad about myself.


The full post:

1.) Realizing I'm almost 22 and still a virgin &amp; never had a girlfriend just makes me so sad. 95% of people my age have done it and I'm still clueless. I missed my chance of being normal. Seeing couples my age or younger destroyes me and my self esteem. Something so normal to others is so foreign to me.  Other dudes can get girls so easily while I can't even look in the eyes of a girl that I find attractive. And I feel unworthly of these girls. I can't see myself getting a good girlfriend. I see a dude with a hot girlfriend and think ""absolutely not in my life could I get a girl like that."" I can't imagine a good girl wanting me when she has so many options.

Dating apps, social media, and what I see in real life generally makes me unhopeful and discouraged about dating.  

The popular ""80/20"" rule incels and the redpill love realistically isn't true, but just for adults (25+) looking for ltr and marriage. I honestly feel like 80/20 rule is completely true for young people (24 and under). Dating apps, and especially social media is literal proof of the 80/20 rule, especially in young people.  I honeslty believe that at my age, If your not an athlete, socially popular guy like frat boys, or a hot fuck boy, you will always be a second option.  Why do you never hear about these guys having trouble getting girls, yet on reddit I see countless posts about introverted 18-24 year old male virgins in a similar situation as me. And when I go on social media all I see are girls talking about their latest crush (with pics of literal chads) or the last athlete or fuckboy they hooked up with. Seeing this is literal suifuel for me because I would never be desired by girls like that. 
I stated online dating 2.5 years ago, and like many others I have no luck.  I really want to be told that dating apps don't reflect real life.  I want to believe I could find a girl that.actually wants me.
Dating apps and social media have destroyed my self esteem.

2.) Having absolutely no friends,  social life, social circles is making me extremely sad and depressed.


Seeing how many friends people have irl and especially on social media makes me feel like garbage. Seeing people's snapchat stories with friends destroys my self esteem.  I have no one to hang out with. I don't know what it feels like to ""hang with the boys"" because I never had a group of guys to hang with.  


I endlessly comparemyself to others. I see that I don't have friends and they do, and I just feel defeated.  I see they are successful and desired, while I'm a failure.

I was ""the kid who sat alone at lunch"" in school. Being bullied has caused me to have severe social anxiety, and that is preventing me from making friends.

Believing I'm currently an observer, watching others live there lives, whether they are good or bad.  I never had a lot of ""milestones"" or experiences most people had growing up.  There are movies, tv shows, and songs that make me nostolgic about shit I never experienced, and then I feel sad that I didn't have the same youth-adulthood that movies, tv shows, and songs told me I was SUPPOSED to have.

And dating without friends is very hard. They say only 40% of people meet on dating apps (that number is growing), and most people meet through friends of friends or occasionally work. That's not possible for someone with no social circles.  You don't exist.  I don't exist.

No one knows I exist

I have bad insomnia and cry alot when I think about everything I mentioned, me waating my youth, not havibg friends, being a virgin, feing behind everyone. I look around and just feel like I am the only person who is truly alone with no support.  I can confidently say that if I dissapeared, no one would notice.

I think I'm depressed, and have been ignoring it for a long time.

Please help me escape this mindset before I continue to waste what's left of my youth",bropill,1606482107,No-Situation849,72,1,True,2020-11-27

I hate myself. And I guess I will live a life of regrets,"Hello bros. I just wanted to vent these things out. 20M Indian, overweight dude, living in Canada here.

Let's start with looks, which is my greatest regrets. I started lifting weight recently. However, I think I do not have much chance of putting on muscle or have visible abs. I know a lot about how to diet and fitness programs, but I do not want to give up on my food. It is not like I eat junk food, but I like my traditional Indian food. I am trying to cut down on animal products a well. And I am very petty about using supplements as I feel they can be unhealthy. I may be wrong about it but I don't want to put things I don't like in my body. I make excellent Indian food, plant-based with less oil as well. So while I can achieve losing my weight, I don't think I can ever achieve a good body. I do things for my face and my skin too. But I don't know if I really look that good because every girl I approached said no to me. Even the ones who know me very well. 

I might sound too old fashioned but I do not like using supplements too. I know I am at a greatest disadvantage. It is difficult for me to put on muscle and I am being pretty stubborn on meat and supplements for protein. I have never actually been interested on having visible abs or being muscular. I am short and I think it won't look that good on me. But everywhere I go, gym, reddit, Instagram or even walking in summer, I see sculpted bodies of men walking around. I feel like I am just doomed in terms of dating because why would anyone find me attractive when so many men actually give a fuck about their looks. Though I am Indian I live in Canada. I know I am just 20 and time will change things, but I feel so useless. I have never been the best physically because of my corrected club food which restricts the range of motion for my ankle. And it starts paining after some time of exerting physically. 

And my ethnicity doesn't help me either. It only makes it worse. It is so annoying to be Indian, short, overweight dude who neither has any achievements to his name either academically or in any other aspect. I feel like it makes me least desirable of all men. It is not that I have a super high paying career ahead of me. I failed 5 courses due to some personal issues and had to change my major from Computing Science, a lucrative field, to Psychology, which is probably good for nothing without further education. On top of that I am on a probation and I am still not doing well academically. If I do not meet the criteria for my probation, I'll be kicked out of college and that is technically a full stop for my life. I should come back to my homeland which I hate with my heart out and no college would be willing to take me in because I do not have valid credits and an older student. Even if I graduate, I would not possibly get a great job. Given my academic track record it is difficult to get a great pay in the starting while my friends will be getting super high paying jobs because they are both computer major, have internships and excellent academic record.

While I do believe that personality is very important and matters more, I feel like I am wasting my youth. Everyone do have their timelines but the people I went to school with are doing wonderful things. There was a point in summer where Covid, my weight gain and inadvertently failing a math course made things worse. I was lonely, away from family and cannot reach them due to travel restriction and constantly saw my friends doing something productive. I felt so bad that I became suicidal. I took therapy sessions which helped me a lot to get back on my feet. But I still feel there are so many cool people having sculpted bodies, doing absolutely wonderful things both physically and academics while I am just surviving. I can do things, only to a certain level. And I am unhappy about it. How do people just workout, look like greek gods and goddesses, get good grades, do awesome things and still be able to party? I'd always have to give up one thing or another because I take time to do things. I feel completely left out and missing out. I feel like wasting my youth. 

I am doing a four-year degree in five years. My marks are nowhere near average. I had a GPA of 1.1 in my first year. My second year was a disaster as well with 1.6. The university have another chance as a result of covid. So grad school plan can be thrown out of the window. I feel so doomed. I am confident of immigrating to Canada, but I'm not sure I'll amount to anything in life. I am nothing without my mom's help, who is very well educated and a highly successful entrepreneur. I always wanted to create my own story but I think I cannot write it without mom's help. And I feel so bad about it. I wanted to be a lawyer, but looks like things won't go that way. I feel like I need to wrap my head around the fact I will die living a mediocre life. And will die with lots of regrets. I hate everything about my life. Being slow. Being Indian. Being short. Being overweight. Being academically unsuccessful. Hell I hate the fact that I am even being sad about such minor issues while children starve to death in my country. The only good thing in my life is my family. My parents, my sister and her husband and my friends. They are super supportive despite everything. And they are the reason I'm still here trying something to get through my life. 

Thanks for listening to what I had to say. I guess it is in my nature and fate to be slow. But I feel like I'd never be as good as others and just be mediocre in life. I wrapped my head around it I guess. But I feel I have so many regrets at 20, I cannot imagine how miserable and dejected I will be in my 60s.",bropill,1606502045,sayinedi,22,1,True,2020-11-27

I don’t know what title this but i just shit in my chest,"My emotions are all over rn and i hate it. I got my heart broken last year and from then it changed me. I found out about trp and my whole attitude about women changed. I’ve always been single but after that i swore off all relationships and all that. I kinda went monk mode and then this summer came and the self improvement i did worked. mad girls wanted me and it felt good. I felt like the man i thought i was becoming a don. Then end of the summer i met one girl and we been chillin and talkin ever since. 

I never had sex w her because we normally be in my car and i don’t know if she’d wanna do it in there. The attraction was there but i’d play games. I wouldn’t text that much and i’d be distant i was tryna make her chase after me. I guess it was working but then i ain’t hear from her for a couple weeks and i thought i for feelings. From then on shit been complicated. I started to care and i don’t know shit been different. I kinda expressed how i feel and i kissed her and from then on i do that when we leave each other. I thought imma start texting her a lil more but now it’s like she pulling back

I hit her we talk for a lil then i get left on read the next day. She ask me to chill then she baits last minute. On thanksgiving i hit her saying happy thanksgiving i’m thankful i met her and it got left on read. Now i feel a way about and tbh i hate. I hopped on this sub and on here i get told it’s not bad to show interest in a girl u like and i wish i didn’t. I feel like i just killed the whole vibe now it feels like i’m chasing. She just watch my snaps and shit now. I said on snap city plans she just watches it then she post she in the city like damn. She gotta baby so i get she be busy so maybe i’m overthinking it or maybe i’m not. I feel like i’m just getting played or maybe i’m not. i don’t know and this is why i can’t catch feelings for any girl. I don’t care anymore i’d rather be single forever than have to deal with this. Just something like being left on read fucks with me and i can’t stand it. When i like a girl i don’t wanna talk to no one else so i just end up assed out i the end. We had a good ass vibe and now i feel like ruined it. Now i’m back to doing the same shit. My life don’t revolve around women. I work, i for friends, i workout, i started making music, I have shit going on but it felt nice to have a good vibe w a girl. i don’t know if i’m being petty but i stopped texting her after thanksgiving. Maybe i’m overthinking it but i’d rather just cut it off then be stuck wondering. 

I let a girl in and this is what happens. I should just take my ass back to trp sub where i belong.",bropill,1606578902,Danielsavv,9,1,True,2020-11-28

I would like to type out some traumatic things that happened to me (With question at the end),"The earliest thing I can remember is being terrified of my grandpa.  He was about 50 I believe? He was a spry motherfucker, I knew he could run cause he chased after me when I tried to run away from his house one time. He was suppose to spank me with a belt when I misbehaved, but it always ended up in him just hitting me with a belt, sometimes a little backhand as well. I remember one time he grabbed me by the feet (I was young and small then) and hanged me upside down. I couldn't really do anything. I remember definitively one time, I must have done something truly bad, he chased me into a corner while screaming. I said I was sorry through tears as he belted me, and I couldn't  run away cause I was cornered. I remember afterwards his girlfriend (who was also always there) didn't make eye contact with me for a while, I don't know why.

Around the same time, my dad had just been recently laid off, so he was very stressed all the time, very agitated all the time. This would often culminate in random, unpredictable screaming.  One time I cracked some mirror or something and he said ""it's just a thing, we can buy more things"". But another time I damaged a chair or something and he promptly screamed. I could never predict what was gonna happen with that guy.

One time, while I was learning to read Polish for my Polish school, I was stuttering a lot. He got ticked and yelled at me at why I'm so stupid and why can't I read this right and so on. I got scared and started to cry, but I had to keep reading. Of course, I only made more errors. When I stopped reading, he slammed his fist against the table and yelled ""NIE!"" and knocked over some things. I ran away and hid in my closet. After a while, I came out and my father apologized and said he was just mad, and I forgave him.

One time, while I was eating soup with my father and sister, I swallowed a piece of potato or something. I started to choke. In fact, I started to tear up and get out of my chair and onto the floor. I was young at the time so I didn't really know what to do. I started hitting my stomach in an attempt to make me vomit. I eventually spit out thing I was choking on and some spit. It must have been quite the spectacle, because my sister and father were laughing at me the whole time. Not even an attempt to help me. I got all pouty when I expressed my anger that they didn't help me, but my dad just said I was overreacting and that I was probably just faking the choke anyways. I was definitely not, I thought I was going to pass out. 

This one time, while my mom was in her room, I wandered in and asked her what she was doing. She went on to explain that she was trying to make her boobs bigger because my dad didn't find her attractive anymore, and how men love big boobs, and so on. I really didn't like to hear it, I just sort of politely listened as my mom explained how she wasn't satisfied in sex anymore and so on.  It was really weird and I wished she didn't tell me.

One time, my family went on a trip to a fair in Fall. Everyone wanted to go into a haunted house except me, because I was scared. We all went anyways. It was a walking kind of haunted house, and I hated it. However, something malfunctioned, and a door wouldn't open or something. So now we were trapped in this fucking place. I started to cry and loudly prayed the ""Hail Mary"" prayer. My dad told me to shut up. I got stressed cause my dad and mom and sister were all stressed so I was also stressed. In the end, some employee let us out. Once it was done, my family teased me for how much of a baby I was.

On a different trip, a road trip, my family stopped for KFC. My sister and I didn't want any but my parents did. They got into a horrible argument in the car, right in front of us. They threw the food everywhere, all over us and the car. My sister and I had to clean off as we watched our parents scream at each other. The inside-roof of the car was permanently stained with a grease stain. 

Around the same time, I had a teacher, who I also mentioned in one of my earlier posts in this sub. I'll keep it short here, but basically she was very attentive to me specifically. She would wrap her arm around my waist unprompted, rub my shoulders, kiss me, ect, and I always hated it. I didn't tell anybody, actually still never had, but it was also a stresser in that time in my life.

Around the same time also, my father and mother got into a horrible horrible screaming argument, more so than usual. My dad throws things when he's really pissed, so he was throwing his fun and knocking things over. The argument sprawled into my sister's room, upon which my dad knocked over entire shelfs of stuff. At the time, my sister's room was next to mine, so I heard everything. What a horrible sound, my sister yelling ""I'm gonna call the police! I'm gonna call the police!"" through tears while my dad was yelling at my mom to shut up and my mom screaming how much she fucking hates him and so on. Once it was over, my mom said something I'll never forget ""It was just an argument, we don't call the police on family."" I don't think I'll ever forget it. 

At around 8 to 9 years old, I attempted suicide. Well, I was never hospitalized or caught, so I don't know if that's no longer a suicide attempt as much as a suicide failure. I don't know. At any rate, my plan to kill myself was to take a butcher knife, about 3/5 the length of my forearm at the time, and gut myself from the top of my chest down to my groin. I slipped the knife down my skin multiple times, hyping myself up for it. However, I heard my mother walk down the hall. I turned around from a 90 degree wall, so she could see my head and not my knife. I quickly put the knife away and pretended like nothing happened.

My dad is an alcoholic. My mom provides the beer for him, and whenever I asked why she did so even though she verbally expressed her disdain for his alcoholism to us, she never answered, but we all knew why.

Flash forward a few years and now I'm a teenager. I had just discovered my love for the sport of swimming, getting really into my hobbies, discovering my body by puberty, and so on. I'm still bedwetting for some reason, and it's really stressing me out. I wouldn't stop bedwetting till around 8th grade. 

I don't remember much from my, I guess you can call them, tween years? (like 11-13ish). Actually, I don't remember much at all from those years. Apparently, I had a birthday in Florida around that time, my mom told me recently. She showed my photos and sure enough I did. I can remember some things that were set into motion though. My sister, who was around 17-18 at the time, had just started to smoke and drink. One of my cousins was caught dealing drugs to high schoolers. My dad refused to keep in contact with one of my uncles and I haven't seen him since. Around this time my sister was explaining very loudly on how she gives a good blowjob, and I overheard it since we were sharing a bunk bed, and it made me very uncomfortable.

Around this time, my sister and father got into a little saga of arguments. They were really bad, lots of door slamming and name calling and whatnot. I remember my sister screaming ""I use to respect you but now I have no respect for you"" and so on. My father started to cry, which was a surreal thing to see. He locked himself in the bathroom and I was scared that he was going to kill himself. He didn't, and the argument sort of fizzled out, until it would reignite randomly some other day.

Now, here's a little memory that's a bit funny to me, I don't know how else to describe it. I had completely forgotten this memory until my mom brought it up in a screamfest my parents were having some weeks ago. Once she brought it up, the memory came rushing back, it was a bit surprising. But now that I re-remembered it, I'm like ""oh yeah, that did happen"". I don't know how to describe it buts kinda like that anyways:

I broke my mom's rule! I called the police on my dad. One night, while in a heated argument, my dad slammed his phone against the floor and my mom gasped loudly. I was in a different room and I thought my dad just hit my mom. So I fled to the basement and called the police. Meanwhile, my mom went into the bathroom to take a bath. My dad went psycho and kicked down the door (she locked it) while my mom yelled ""What the fuck are you doing?"" and so on. What a horrible horrible sound. Anyways, the cops show up and all is explained. My dad never laid a finger on my mom, I just tweaked and assumed the worst. That's what they told the police, and that's what they told my sister and I. After the cops left, my dad was all on my case about how much of a bitch I was and now this is on his record and how could you do this to me and so on. But even now I can't help but to have my doubts about what really happened, especially since my mom slapped my dad hard once before in a previous argument.

About 2 years ago, my sister started her career as a hair-cutter person (don't know the proper term). She was in beauty school and part of her course was a nail-painting section (or something like that, point is she had a lot of nail polish). Well, my dad didn't like the smell of the stuff, so he marched downstairs (my sister's room was downstairs, my parent's room was upstairs), screamed at her, and promptly smashed and destroyed all her nail polish. It was very loud, it's a small house,  so all I heard was the sound of things braking and my sister crying ""I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"". Horrible noises. Once it was done, I don't know what prompted me - but I went through the garbage where my sister had thrown out the pieces and got them all back for her. I offered it to her, she said thank you but insisted i t was garbage, so I threw it away again.

One night, at around 3 AM, I was sleeping soundly in my room. My parents returned drunk from a party. My dad suddenly shrieked at the top of his lungs about some bullshit. It awoke me suddenly. I remember this incident not so much for the yelling, but the whiplash. You have to understand - it was from unconscious slumber to sudden, random yelling in the blink of an eye, it was crazy.

Around this time, one random night, my mom returned from a weekend vacation. My dad prepared a steak for her. I greeted my mom and went to take a shower. While I was showering, my dad started screaming. Now, I must emphasize: this felt wholly random. Like, one second he's all chipper and the next he's screaming, so sporactic.  Anyways, my mom started crying and whatnot. Later, I learned my dad yelled cause my mom said she didn't like the steak. I was very pissed, it was the first time in a long time I was angry at my dad instead of afraid of him. But - what could I do, really? Absolutely nothing. My mom came into my room (which is how I found out why my dad yelled), and I confided in her that I don't want to live here anymore, and she emphasized and we hugged. 

Around this time, while I was on my high school swim team, I did poorly at a meet. My coach railed me hard, and it made me feel just fucking abysmal. I trained to make him proud of me, so seeing him so upset with me just broke me. That night, before a bath, I very seriously contemplating whether or not I should take a razor and bleed to death in my tub. Obviously, I didn't. Actually, I still have my suicide letter in my possession. 

On January 1st, 2018, my pet dog Smokey died. She died because I friend I entrusted to care for her wasn't paying attention to her and she was run over by a car and died a slow, painful death. Happy New Year. Smokey and I were the best of friends, even if things were tough, we had each other. Now she was dead. Now, the death of a pet is always painful for anyone. But I hope you understand when I say that Smokey was my anchor clinging me to life and sanity. When she died - died such a grizzly death - and died in the hands of someone I trusted - it broke me, and the truth is I still haven't fully recovered emotionally. 

And so life went on. However, there were some caveats. For one - in absence of Smokey, I needed a new outlet to relieve stress, so I masterbated more (I hope this sub of all subs understands this). I developed a porn addiction and soon I masterbated not when I was aroused, but when I was stressed or sad. 

Later, I took up a new stress-relief: cutting. I knew cutting wrist would be too obvious, so I did my feet. I must say - it feels so so so fucking validating to see your own scars. Often when I cut, I can't stop until a sufficiently deep enough wound is inflicted so I can feel like a success. Recently, I've been cutting quite deep, and there's enough rationality in me still to know I shouldn't be doing this. But I can't help it - it feels amazing if I'm being honest.

I haven't had a good night's rest in, well actually I don't remember since when, maybe my whole life? I can't help but to remember some of these events or some other ones I didn't mention in this post (there are many, believe me, but this post is already running super fucking long so I'm cutting it here). Hence, I'm kinda tired during the day. But not so much - I can still function and focus quite well, I've gotten better at it over the years.

Sometimes I get what I think might be panic attacks? I say might because I've never been diagnosed by a doctor and self-diagnosis is usually wrong, but I don't know how else to describe it. I remember something awful, relive some scenes of it, get a racing heartbeat, slight sweat. Most apparently, I start to snap my fingers or pound my knee or get up and pace or something. Always something with my hands and making like a clap or whatever. 

I'm also in a bit of a depressive episode right now, which happens from time to time in my life, so maybe that's what inspiring me to post this. Anyways, I promised a question in the title of this post, and here it is:

Is it okay to say I've had it tough? I feel like a fucking idiot for even typing it out, but I can't escape the mentality of it. It's why I like cutting so much - its like proof of suffering. I wonder this because:

\-Its not like my life was a CONSTANT hell hole, I do have some good memories with my parents

\-I have friends

\-I grew up in middle-class suburbia, so we were never poor necessarily (money was tight sometimes but we were never in poverty)

\-I own nice things, like a computer and gaming consoles

\-I have hobbies that I enjoy

\-Most of my life is neutral or good times, it's mostly home and family life that was sometimes hellish.

\-Other friends have had family experiences similar to my own (so maybe this is just part of life?)

So I feel dumb when I ask this. It makes me afraid I'll spiral into self-pity or something. I hope you understand. If you read my entire post: thanks - it's a long read! Anyways, I like to finish on a positive note, so I would like to announce my studies are going well in school and so far my academic future looks promising! 

Thanks for reading, have a good day :)",bropill,1606585326,seb69420,2,1,True,2020-11-28

I've been friends with this guy since Sophomore year of high school, we're now both in 3rd year of uni. I've always felt like we were close friends,though since I came out he really struggled with properly gendering me. I wasnt upset, he did care and knew me as a boy for 4 years, it can take some getting used to. 

He invited two other people into our group, who turned out to be ""edgy"" types, one of them I'd call a chud. Needless to say, the misgendering problem only got worse the more those three hung out. My girlfriend, who's very supportive of me got upset one day and brought this up to the old friend. He then told the other two, after which they promptly left our group chats, and blocked me.

I just feel like really stupid about it. The guy was a close friend for years, then I have an issue with his edgy friends, and someone who I thought cared about me just leaves.

I feel like I’m becoming disconnected from my friends,"I’ve always been one to struggle with making friends, and it wasn’t until my junior year of high school that I finally started making a good group of friends.

Now, I’m learning about how they’re always getting drunk and how many people they’re having sex with (as well as how often they have it with each other). I don’t want to come off as prudish but it just seems to paint them in a different light than who I became friends with. I’m not discouraging that lifestyle, but I’ve had to tell a couple of them that I don’t want to talk about that kind of stuff.

How can I make my group of friends more understanding of asexuality and stop being aphobic towards a fellow Bro?,"Hi bros, sorry if the post is a bit long but this is a complicated issue

I'm having quite a difficult time when it comes to the inclusion of a long time friend in our group of former high school class mates because of his asexuality. The issue came up only one time so far (but probably now that I think about it also during other micro aggressions before) when, almost a year ago, he came out to us while we were coming back from a trip.

Now the first issue that is directly connected to this is how he thinks of himself as an asexual guy, in fact during the coming out he basically described it as a condition, I think he even said the world ""disease"" and at the time I tried to say that it was all fine and normal but I don't think I did enough to make him understand this (I'm sorry but within groups of friends even if I'm perfectly comfortable I can't really speak up for myself and my ideas especially if they go against the grain, I think this has to do with my social anxiety). So basically now I need a way to bring up the issue again with him in private, yesterday we were by ourselves in a whatsapp call and I tried to introduce the issue with a meme about the asexual flag (basically a communist version of it cause he always likes to jokingly poke on me for being some sort of commie) but it didn't go very well, I need a way to inform him correctly about asexuality and make him understand that I want to support him and that I can explain it correctly to our friends.

The second problem was the reactions of our friends during the coming out, especially one of them. They weren't informed at all, like most people in my country, about the existence of this sexual orientation, and they dismissed it completely like a phase of his life. I especially don't like how they bringed up a lot of machistic and toxic concepts about male sexuality, like telling him that ""after all he would get hard if he actually had a naked lady in front of him"" or finding especially weird the fact that he never masturbates and going on for a long time about how he should try it for his own good, etc.

Now I don't think that my friends are a lost cause or reactionary, I think currently one of them is center right-wing while another just doesn't care (but I'm bringing him close to anarchism hehe) although they aren't very progressive either, so I don't think that a simply fact-based approach here could work alone to bring them to accept asexuality and stop being weird about it. One approach in my opinion is to use the internalized virgin-shaming we are all feeling (cause we're all virgins in out 20s, another important detail perhaps) as a bridge to create solidarity, since I see they are interested to discuss men's issues already.

So what do you think? Tell me what approach is the best in your opinion and if any of you is asexual and went through something similar in a friend group. Thanks",bropill,1606669076,Eraser723,2,1,True,2020-11-29
"Don't worry about being a ""nice guy"", just enjoy the hell out of people for who they are","I just have to get this off my chest.

This whole r/niceguys trope is frustrating because it just makes fun of guys who themselves don't understand what's going on. These guys are trying, they really are, it’s just that they have been given absolutely no direction. Making fun of them because they misunderstand themselves doesn't encourage growth.

So here it is: everyone sees through you. This is true for us all and always will be.

Work with it, not against.

Guys who are trying to be ""nice"" are misrepresenting what's going on inside. Inside they're desperate for favor from others, and that means that their niceness comes off as transactional. They want something from you and are using niceness to get it.

That's actually a pretty hateful approach to relating to people. You're placing no value on that person apart from what you can get from them.

And THAT'S why nobody wants to date you.

Meanwhile there are others who genuinely like people. They want to know more about others, are thrilled at other people's highs and lows, and spend most of their interactions just appreciating every little thing a person reveals about themselves. 

Those people actually like you. 

And THAT'S why sometimes they can come off as ""obnoxious""... because they spend exactly 0% of their energy worrying about how they present themselves. It all goes to just enjoying the hell out of whoever they're with - as a person. As a human being.

Which is why people want to date them.

Now if you find yourself consumed by loneliness (or especially the need for sex) you can start thinking like a ""nice guy"" in order to strategically scratch that maddening itch inside. It's understandable. Hell, it's probably even a natural tendency, especially if you're feeling insecure.

So you have to train yourself. 

It takes time, but every time you interact with anybody at all you need to spend the entire interaction finding out more about them. How do they feel? What have they experienced? What are their favorite things? What do they think?

And no matter what their answer is, appreciate it for what it is. You don't have to agree (be genuine and don't suck up!) but you do have to seek understanding and be interested. FOR REAL interested. 

Start with easy mode with people who not only are unattractive to you but also ""uncool"". It's easy to not be fake around them and to just develop that curiosity. 

Then, once you feel you've got it down, seek out ""cool"" people and discover what makes them tick.

Then, finally, people you find attractive. 

Never once consider what they think if you. You're exploring them as a person and enjoying the hell out of the journey. Victory is if you found a way to appreciate them and expressed that enjoyment that doesn’t demand anything in return. That's it.

And that's how you graduate from ""nice guy"" to ""someone people want to be around"" without any pit stops in ""asshole"" or ""simp"".

Hopefully this makes sense to someone somewhere... probably not... but at least I got it out.",bropill,1606677933,Ohigetjokes,6,1,True,2020-11-29
"I cried yesterday writing a holiday card to my sister, who I haven’t seen in months (out of state). When was the last time you cried, bro?","Yesterday, my girlfriend and I were writing out our holiday cards to our friends &amp; family. This is a new thing for us, as she just moved in with me at the beginning of the year. She’s the best, I love living with her so much.

As we were writing our cards, it was pretty standard stuff. “Can’t wait for the next party when things are safe!” “Hope your holidays are merry &amp; bright!” “Hope you and yours are well.” The usual stuff, no big deal.

Then I got to my sister’s card. She’s my only full sibling and we’ve been through the ringer together. Our parents separated and eventually got divorced when we were both in high school. Our dad was an alcoholic and was verbally abusive to me, a trait that my sister picked up growing up. Our mom was strict and harsh, but loving. We’re in the best place we can be now, with both our parents remarried, even if she doesn’t talk to my dad anymore.

When I started writing her card, I was doing fine until it came time to write the “I love you and I miss you” part. My chin curled up and my chest got tight. I couldn’t hold back, and I just started crying. I haven’t cried in a while and it just came out of me.

My girlfriend was so supportive and told me it was okay to cry, she held me and got me a hanky to wipe my tears. She didn’t tell me to “man up”, she didn’t dismiss my feelings, she didn’t try to make it about her. She really supported me when I needed it and I love her for it.

How do you get over rejection burnout?,"I tried to get back into online dating. For the longest time, I wasn't getting matches. I went to a seminar hosted by this dating coach. I got off Tinder and Bumble. I switched over to Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel. I'm starting to get matches and women messaging back.

The problem is- I just can't. The online conversations will lead to ghosting. If they don't lead to ghosting, they lead to a single date. If I try to get a second date, I'm told absolutely not. If I ask why, I'm never told or allowed to know. The cycle repeats.

The idea of sex is in the same area as visiting a skate park or frying mushrooms. It's something that can be done. I don't feel like I can't. It just doesn't seem like it has any meaning behind it.

I know I'm not asexual. I went out salsa dancing when I was 28. There was this girl there. We talked all night. We danced for a bit. I got her number, but she was in a long term relationship. We stayed in touch, and she's been responsible for some of my happiest memories. Maybe in the past few years. Maybe in my life. I think about her a lot.

I just don't care about myself/ the world is too painful,"Hey bros,

I thought this would be the best place to reach out for support. Thanks &lt;3

I need some help. I've struggled with mental illness my whole life, causing things like depression and suicidal ideation among other things. I've been really good for a few years now, but I recently realized that I only take care of myself so I can stay alive so I don't hurt the people I love, if that makes sense? I try to stay healthy and happy for everyone else, not for me. I realized that when I remove everyone else from the equation, I don't care about myself or wellbeing. I think I deserve to be in pain. The funny thing is I care about everyone else so deeply and would do anything to make someone smile. I think that's what I base my self worth on, and if I ever make a mistake or hurt someone I love I just hate myself so much and get consumed with emotional pain.

I'm spiraling and just don't understand how people can live in this world when it is so full of pain and hurt. I don't know how I can handle life's pain and loss. I don't see how the good outweighs the bad, or how the painful parts of life are what make it ""beautiful"". I honestly believe that anyone who tells themselves that is lying to themselves. I know it's pessimistic and harsh, but I just can't see how we can be happy in this world when so much is going wrong out of our control, like climate change, and we lose people we love. So why would I even attempt to like or care about myself, when I'm just going to get knocked down again, you know? I genuinely feel incapable of being a person because I shut down just imagining what I might go through in my life. I'm overwhelmed.

I might be catastrophizing, but I also have had 2 family members and 1 friend die in my life and I'm just 24. It took me years to deal with that. 

How can I actually like myself and treat myself like I would someone I love? How can I continue with life without being consumed by the pain?

I can't get physical with any girl and it is making me depressed,"English is my second language and it is almost 1AM so sorry for my grammer errors and please dont get stuck on words while reading it. If I used a wrong word I probably did it because I dont know how to explain myself better.

I dont know how to write about a subject like this so I guess I'll start with giving info. I'll be 17 in a few months. I've had 6 girlfriends yet the most far I've gone is kissing one of them in the cheek once and it took 6 months and a lot of effort to get there. Other than that all my relationships lasted around 3-4 months.

I live in a small conservative city and I think thats one of the big reasons. Girls I had a relationship with was all in for getting romantical but as soon as I tried to get physically intimate or even talk about anything remotely sexual they got uncomfortable and said or hinted I was acting too quick. By saying physically intimate I mean basic things like holding hands. Pretty much every guy I know in my city has been in the same spot but they are okay with waiting 6 months to cuddle.

Yeah small city conservative parents and all but I still dont get it. Why it has to be this hard. We are teenagers for fucks sake. Am I really acting too quick? I dont think I should spend months or even years building a relationship for the same emotional and physical level that my friends who live in more secular cities can achieve two times quicker than me.

"Need some advice on being assertive, but being gentle about it.","Alright bros, long story incoming, sorry in advance but appreciate any advice.

So a few months ago, I got word that a friend-of-a-friend was going through a rough time and needed somewhere to stay for a short while. I only knew the guy loosely, but he seemed nice enough and my couch was free so I offered to take him in for a month, which I amended to 2 months because I realized a month isn't really enough time to get anything serious done.

And so the dude moved in with me, and I've internally regretted it ever since. He's made my whole living room a mess (small one-bedroom apartment, so he just has the entryway/living room as his room) with food bags and wrappers everywhere, doesn't clean up after himself in the kitchen, says he'll take out the trash and then doesn't do it for days, etc. I can't have people over because the place it absolutely unsightly and I'm afraid I'll get roaches with the amount of food wrappers lying around. He's also monopolized the living room ""hangout space"" with his massive gaming PC setup which blocks my TV and consoles.

Dude has no job, which is understandable during these times, but he's on voice calls with his buddies during literally all waking hours and even during hours that I'm trying to sleep (3am - 11am is my usual schedule and he'll be streaming or talking to people during these times, more often than not). He's also apparently been using my internet to pirate stuff because I got the first ever ISP copyright infringement notice of my life a couple weeks ago, and I haven't pirated anything.

He has no car so I let him use my borrow my spare car while he's staying with me. It's kind of a beater at this point, the interior is falling apart but I've at least kept the drivetrain and wheels/tires well-maintained. But I noticed last week that he did some damage to it: he must've hit a curb pretty hard because he broke off a whole spoke of the hubcap and bent the wheel rim itself, which is going to cost me $165 in repairs without addressing the cosmetic damage. He never fessed up to this even after I told him today that I took the car in for repairs to a damaged wheel. Additionally, it smells like he may have been smoking in my car, which he never asked to do and I never would have allowed.

While I'm glad I could help this guy out during a difficult time, and many of our mutual friends have commended me for doing so, I'm pretty sick of dealing with all the headaches it's caused. He's flat broke so there's no chance he'll be able to help pay for my car repairs (not to mention the $40 he already owed me before that), and there's one week left before my offering of 2 months has been used up but he's given no indication that he's been looking for other people to stay with. In fact, last week I heard him talking to his friends on voice (not snooping, the walls are paper) and he mentioned to them ""I'm only here until March, but I'll have to figure out where to go from there."" I remember mentioning to him that my lease expires in March, but definitely did not tell him that he was free to stay until then.

So bros, how do I let this guy know that he needs to GTFO ASAP? I don't want to throw him out onto the street but like... this is costing me a lot of money and I can't have friends over or use my living space. It's also costing me sleep because his incessant voice chatting keeps me up at night and I can't sleep with earplugs very well. I've already decided that I'm not going to let him use my car anymore unless he at least agrees to pay for the damages sometime in the future when he can afford it, which I feel is more than generous.

He's told me he has borderline personality disorder, which I've read can make people especially sensitive to criticism, so I want to be as gentle as possible when telling him that he's not allowed to use my car and that he's about to be overstaying his welcome. I suck at being assertive and I don't want to blow up at him even though I'm really frustrated with his inconsiderate, greedy behavior. Any advice? I'm not an assertive person and I've kinda just been letting him walk all over me because I want to be seen by him and our mutual friends and ""helpful,"" but I can't take it anymore tbh. Thanks for any advice &lt;3",bropill,1606780859,throwaway-49878654,3,1,True,2020-11-30
How to recover from rock bottom?,"Hey bros, this is going to be a somewhat intense post.  If you struggle reading that type of thing, I'd recommending skipping this one.

I'm pretty certain I want to commit suicide.  The more time passes, the less value I'm able to see in the things people have to make them happy.  It's partially sadness and depression, but there's an element of earnest, truly wanting to do it in there too I want to confront.  My relationship is rocky, my family is at best not present and at worst actively trying to take my money and other such shit, so forth.  I have friends, who are mostly good, but all of whom are, I think the best way to put it is emotionally underdeveloped.  They're just not great at what I might need at the moment.

Got a phone call today about a job offer that I do want.  And I was briefly really happy, but was then overwhelmed by feelings like, ""So what?  You can go slave away for a different person who will lay you off when Covid gets a little worse?""  I've lost my will to improve, I don't have any hopes or expectations of the future, it feels like to do anything I would have to climb a mountain while every entity in the world would be trying to kick me back down.

It's great that some people can pick themselves up and fight back against that resistance.  And I used to.  World events and watching the decay of people I love who are ambivalent to the seriousness of Covid, I can't help but think that if no one else is trying, why should I?  The best I can hope for is middle class in my country and the quality of that is droppping year by year, and nearly every man I know aged 50+ is in a terrible medical state due to how much they've given their lives to their work to get nothing at all in return.  I was a great student, a great worker, have a great resume, yet I feel like I and everyone else on earth are just cogs in the machine no matter what I do, think, or want.

So what's there to work toward?  Where do I find motivation when mine's been lost and I'm compelled to believe any effort is pointless?  Right now, I can't seem to justify doing anything at all except waiting for the final straw, and it looks more inviting each day.",bropill,1606781413,handshakeguy1,4,1,True,2020-11-30
just discovered this sub and it feels like the best plave to ask for help and post this,"This is just gonna be a rant/asking for advice or help type post I guess. I just want to be able to talk about these things somewhere.

So I guess I'll start first with the biggest thing on my mind right now which I am really struggling with, which is my mental health. Im currently a freshman in college and having a really hard time doing the work. Ive always been a 'gifted' kid and never really had to put work into things. In about 10th grade it started getting really hard and I started having mental health issues. The school counselor originally thought it was depression, but later she thought maybe I have adhd. Over the summer I went to the doctor for a vaccine and he also recommended I get tested for adhd which I have my first appointment for in December. The issue is I am falling really really behind in one of my classes, and it is an important class for my major (music ed if ur curious). My parents don't know about it and I really don't want to tell them about it. I've emailed the professorr a few times explaining that I'm behind but I couldn't tell him why and I feel like I emailed too much. I've told my trombone prof as well and he just kinda encourages me to get through it but it doesn't help. I Just can't physically make myself do the work and there's only 3 weeks left in the semester and I just need help. Ive tried to rest and relax and it doesn't help. I stay up really late because I haven't done my work and I can't sleep until I do but then I still don't do it.


Another thing I wanted to post about us not asking for help, but I just wanted to say that I got a date! I've been talking to this girl that I met in college and eventually we started getting dinner together and would talk for hours on end. I asked her to paint my nails and now I have pretty nails. I worked up the courage to ask her out because she asked me if Ive ever dated anyone and I told her no but I've been rejected a bunch, and she said that she wouldn't turn me down if I asked, so I did. The date is tomorrow! Were gonna color and talk. I just wanted to post because I don't have many people to tell how happy I am about this


Lastly, I have a question about sexuality that I figured I might as well ask here as well. I am a guy and have generally been attracted to girls my whole life, but recently I've been finding myself calling lots of guys attractive and thinking about it. The main reason I am confused is because I think they guys and girls are attractive but I don't know if I would want a super intimate relationship with a guy. Would I be considered bisexual or is this something most straight guys feel at some point?


I am just having a hard time with lots of things right now and would really appreciate some advice, nice messages or just saying anything",bropill,1606782285,DepressedBandBoi,4,1,True,2020-11-30
Can you cut someone off whos an Addict and Sucidial?,"Hi Bros,
I need some advice in personal things from you. To explain the situation i have to go back a year and give you some background.

Summer 2019 a friend from my friendgroup from highschool ( we had graduated a year earlier) wo i was friends with for the better part of highschool came out as transgender, which i and all of our mutual friends totally supported. To make things clear ill call her Marie ( not her real name). She had allready a long history of drug usage before she came out, which changed as she started her hormon therapy. She told me she stopped smoking weed almost entirely and hadnt taken any other drugs in a while, which was a big step ahead from smoking like 1-2 grams a day and regular trips on various substances.
I was very happy to hear those developments and was very proud of her achievement.

In late 2019 i moved to another town 3 hours away so we stopped excercising together regularly ( we had a habit of meeting at the bouldder gym 2 times a week). When i was home for christmas we met and she told me about her problem with depressive episodes which she had dealt with / is still dealing with.

In february of 2020 i heard from her very little, she talked to me a short while about how her life was going and it didnt seem half bad to me until she told me of a time  her personality seem to have been temporarly divided. She told me that her old “ pre coming out male self“ had manifested in her head and she had a talk with him for a weekend until he rejoined with her. She seemed very happy and told me this as if it was nothing unusual. This was the first time i became seriously worried about her. She noticed and told me that she was seeing a therapist, which calmed me down a bit.

In august ( we hadnt talked since) she messaged me out of the blue at 4 am in the morning and told me she was certain a mutual friend ( who is to me like a sister) had done harm to herself. The friend (lets call her Sofie) had told us about some episodes of depression in the past.  Marie told me she was certain because of a feeling she had without any evidence at all. She tried to call the parents of Sofie and was about to call the emergency services to bust down Sofies door but i managed to calm her down. As you might imagine this shook me up quit hard, telling someone their childhood friend tried to kill themself without any evidence is to say it litely pretty hard to deal with as a person. When i asked Sofie in the morning everything was fine and she had just been asleep. At this point i was seriously worried about Marie and after some texting i learned that she  stopped going to her therapist. 

In August 2020 she texted me out of the blue again and told me shad been verbally assaulted by dome guys on the street and had to flee with her girlfriend. This was very traumatising for her as some might imagine and she had axiety attacks thr following days. In a text message she told me lightheartedly that she was taking heroin to deal with her anxiety. She told me she had done this a few time in the past allready. I couldnt really say much more than pleading for her to look for professional help. I tried to distance myself from this as far as possible so it wont affect me more then it allready does. 

This is how we get to tonight. This evening she messaged me and told right away that she had tried to kill herself and she is now in a psychatric facility with a specialisation in drug adicction. I have yet to answer her message because ive not dealt with her suicide attempt yet. I dont know what to say to her. I dont want to make her feel like i dont care because i do. On the other side i cant deal with this. Ive seen her life spiral out of controll and i couldnt do anything but watch and tell her to get help. She seems to trust me, because she tells me these things but i dont think handle it anymore. Is it wrong to tell someone that in such a unstable condition that she just cant dump these things on me? I dont know what to do anymore. My life is stressfull and filled with enough anxiety about myself without having to worry  about her.

I am sorry for the long text but i am so agitated and i had to vent this story somewhere. Ill talk to Sofie tomorrow and share the text message with her because i dont think i can deal with this alone.

I feel like my best friend is too into my SO,"This sounds super bad and I feel too guilty about even thinking this but I think I have to get it out somewhere. I have been dating my SO for around 6 months. It's lockdown so I can't really go out and meet him a lot. My best friend hasn't met him yet. Now my SO is super into social sciences and my best friend is going to attend a 3-day workshop for that this december. Now she is like can you give me SO's number so that I can send him links and talk to him about all this? Now this wouldn't have been weird in it self except that we have other friends who are super interested and working in social sciences as well and she doesn't seem pretty interested in talking to them about this(She hardly even knows my SO right now). Also previously she had also asked me to send her written poems and a paper she had written for school to my SO as well so hear his opinion.   
I'm not really sure where I'm going with this. I just want to know if I'm overthinking this :3 or if I'm to talk to my best friend about this how to go about it. My best friend has also previously flirted with her friends' partners before. Although this was before we were best friends and I just figured it was because she was going through a hard time and all this is behind her now. 

I know this post sounds and feels super weird but I honestly have no idea to talk this out anywhere else. My best friend is a part of our friend circle so I can't really voice my concerns there.",bropill,1606810091,fullbullpenne12,2,1,True,2020-12-01

I'm not where I want to be and I don't know how to get there.,"I know what my barriers are, but I don't know if I can overcome them.

I'm disabled by depression and C-PTSD. I used to be an active danger to myself, but after \~500+ hours of therapy, and twenty different psychotropic prescriptions (few of which had any positive effects), getting on SSDI, and creating a decent support system, I am now relatively stable. No-self harm, no abusing sleeping pills, no suicide attempts or hospitalizations in over a year : ) It's taken years, but it's brogress.  


But I can't seem to make myself do much of anything. Giving enough of a shit to do anything feels impossible. I'm always tired. I've seen sleep pathologists, who always say ""Oh, it's *just* your depression. Go to therapy!"" But after 500+ hours and all those psych meds, I've more or less exhausted the extent of medical resources available to treat my depression. The only things left to try are neuromodulation -- ECT, TMS, or esketamine, and some recent studies (and the so-called Replication Crisis) have me seriously doubting the effectiveness of mental health treatments in general. Personal experience has shaken my trust in psychology as well, after being ghosted by therapists more than once, and after experiencing transphobia from people who's one job is to provide emotional support (and not distress).  


Last week Monday, I experienced some serious transphobia and ableism from a sleep pathologist, who for some reason turned an appointment about my fatigue into a conversation about how ""trans people don't count as a minority,"" and, ""you'll probably feel better if you get a job."" Everyone's been encouraging me to write or call the doctor's office to make sure that another patient doesn't have to go through what I did. When I think about typing this email to the doctor's office, I think: *to what end?* Why should I even bother? What's the point? No matter what I do, trans and disabled people are still going to experience constant indignities at best, and several of us will continue to suffer or die from medical neglect. Sending off a Karen-style email isn't gonna change that.

  
And even worse, *I kinda don't care.* Maybe I do, but not enough to expend what little energy I have. I wish I had passion for life. Instead it's like I'm just watching from the sidelines. I'm too scared and too tired to get involved in anything. And it's horribly unfulfilling. I've just been filling the time with YouTube and video games. Distractions. I'm not taking an active role in my own life and I don't know if I'll ever be able to change that.

&amp;#x200B;

It hurts even more having been bragged about as a kid; being told I had so much potential in academics and fine arts. When I try to get back into hobbies I loved when I was younger, I feel bored and insecure by the results. Having critical thinking skills is probably cool when you're emotionally stable and energetic enough to complete college and work in a field where those skills are valued. But due to my unpredictable energy levels, I haven't managed to finish a degree despite starting college nine years ago. I've taken so many breaks. Being unable to work a job and only making $800/month from disability, I'm scared out of my mind that I'll never be able to pay back my debts.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trapped in a miserable limbo between over and under stimulation. When I try to add something to my life to shake things up a little, I become too anxious and overwhelmed to tolerate it. It's purgatory. Every barrier I face now seems totally insurmountable. I just want to move onto the next thing and be the person I know I can be.",bropill,1606857142,trans_catdad,1,1,True,2020-12-01
"I finally figured out why my ex ended our long distance relationship, but I still can't process it","  

I feel like I just need to articulate my feelings somewhere.

I had never been in relationship before or had so much as kissed a girl, but a year ago I started to get the impression that this girl I knew was interested in me. I had been very anxious and lacking in self-confidence, but I was starting to get over that and becoming more outgoing. All of my previous romantic experiences had resulted in rejection, but I felt ready to try again.

So, I asked her out, it wasn’t explicitly a date or anything but both of us had a good time. The problem was that I was leaving to study abroad for several months so it couldn’t be anything long term or serious, I didn’t intend it to be either. The night before I left my friends threw me a leaving party, and she kissed me, I couldn’t believe it. Later in the evening when we were walking home, she asked me back to hers, but I blew it. I don’t think I showed enough interest and then she said that she didn’t want to be in a position where she wanted it more than I did, but she did seem genuinely upset that I was leaving. We agreed to just see what things were like when I got back.

I was gutted at this point because I somehow managed to blow the one chance I had ever had, but we stayed in touch over the months. We did a lot of facetiming and chatting, and we both wanted to see each other when I got back. I spent those months thinking about nothing else, which probably made me not have as much fun as I could have done. But I was actually forced back early due to the Coronavirus outbreak, and we met up once I was back in the country.

I had been looking forward to this for months, being with her was the only thing I wanted to do. Seeing her again was great and we went back to hers, but it ended up being a very bad experience. I couldn’t get hard because of what I assume was nerves and jetlag and so it ended up being a disappointing experience for both of us. I felt so emasculated because I couldn’t live up to this image that she had built me up as. What I had been looking forward to so much crumbled in front of me just like every time before. It was very awkward, neither of us could sleep next to each other so I went to a different bed and didn’t sleep a wink.

In another unfortunate twist of fate, the next day our country was put into a national lockdown and so we were unable to spend any more time together, therefore it was back to messaging. Another five months past and we were planning on finally being able to spend time together in the Autumn when the next academic year started. But in August she stopped messaging me as much, she said that she had been spending time with her friends, so I didn’t want to pester her too much, but I began to feel like something was wrong. She had suggested meeting in a few weeks time but when it came and I asked if she still wanted to, she said no because she didn’t have the money, but I knew that wasn’t the real reason.

I finally asked her what was wrong, and she told me that she didn’t really want a romantic relationship, instead we could just be friends. My heart sank, because it confirmed what I had suspected. She couldn’t tell me why, just that she had a lot going on and it didn’t feel right for her. I was so hurt by this, that after so long it just ended as if none of it had mattered. She suggested going for a drink and clearing the air, but talking to her after that became so difficult as she would ignore my messages for days. I got so frustrated that I said that I didn’t want to see her.

We didn’t talk for a while after that, but I got back in touch later to apologise and see if she wanted to meet to talk about things, and she agreed but kept putting it off. Eventually she just ghosted me. I felt so shit. I had no idea why it had all fallen apart, I kept rethinking what I had done to ruin it, or what I could have done differently to fix it. My self-esteem collapsed, even though I was still a virgin, while we were talking I felt like it didn’t matter because at least there was someone that wanted me.

Now I am fairly certain is what had happened was that she had got together with one of her female friends during the summer and chose her over me. Something that had made me happy like nothing else had done before now seemed like a cruel joke at my expense.

I don’t know how to feel. Sometimes I feel angry at her. How could she do that to me? I thought that it had meant something despite us only being able to talk online. She led me on for months only to refuse to see me and lie because she was too afraid to just tell me the truth. Isn’t that the manly response? To be angry, to not take things lying down. Other times I just feel depressed and pathetic, of course I wasn’t good enough. This whole experience raised me out of my self-loathing only to throw me down further than before. I should have seen it coming and I was stupid for getting my hopes up for thinking it wouldn’t end like all of the others.

We haven’t spoken for months now, and I am resigned to the fact that there is nothing to be done now, but I am still really struggling to process this experience. Some days are better than others. Some days I hang out with friends or am able to occupy myself with other things, but some nights I lie awake until 4am running things through my head in the dark. I should really be happy for her, it isn't easy being unsure of your own sexuality. I hope her relationship is fulfilling, I just wish it could have been with me instead. I want to move on, I want to believe that I am a good human being. I want to believe that things will work out eventually. I don’t want to be toxic and self-hating. I want to care about someone intimately and know that they feel the same way about me, but I’m starting to feel like I never will, and I don’t know if this is a possibility I should just accept.

I deleted my accounts on pornography sites and this is my first step towards personal development.,"Hey bros!

I wanted to share it with someone. For the past three years, I have been addicted to pornography. Various things like loneliness, unsuccessful in achieving some goals I had, and new hormonal changes led to that addiction. I had accounts in two sites and used to visit them on daily basis. And I deleted them today. I feel very liberated. 

There were reasons which turned to porn for comfort. I am only 20. I have posted several times on this sub about the sense of doom that I have been having. It has been that way for the past 4 years. I am an Indian undergrad in Canada. However, during the past few years, I had many failures, which may not exactly be failure in everyone's opinion (even me now). 

Failure #1: I had to give up my dream of becoming a cricketer. Not because of parental pressure but simply because I did not have what it takes. I was not fit enough and was performing well academically. 

Failure #2: I failed to get into an Ivy or Ivyish school. I was an outcast in my school. Though I was a good performer academically and was a student leader, people never recognized me. And hence, I wanted to prove my worth by getting into top most schools in the world. But again I did not have to effort or talent to get there. That's my failure #2

Failure #3: I stopped going to school by taking permission as my school is a cram school. Their only focus was to get a high rank in a nationwide entrance exam to a prestigious college in our country called IIT. I have been ridiculed by some teachers and students for aiming to go abroad because I wasn't intelligent enough for the college I was talking about. This made me both socially isolated and miserable because neither did I get into an ivy school nor into an IIT. That's failure #3

Failure #4: I got into a very prestigious school in Canada for my program of choice - Computer Science. But again, I failed. I failed five classes in two years. Never seen the GPA above 2.0. I had to change my major to psychology. Now, it is difficult to get a head start in career and be equal to my peers.

Failure #5: I never really liked CS. However, I was hell bent on doing it because that's where the jobs are. That's what is relevant. In my pursuit of being relevant, I wanted to do it. My peers who had same start as me are doing sixteen-month internships. Starting companies. Doing research. All while I am trying to get passing grades and masturbating.

Failure #6: My inability for having a relationship. Everyone of my age had at least one relationship. Whether India or Canada, it is the same. I don't know if it is my face (I firmly believe I have decent face), my body (possible, I am short and overweight), how I carry myself (my bet that it is this one), or my irrelevance in my leer community. I am not anywhere near developed and do not have my life together. And my attitude and traits I value do not do any favour as well. Being a college student the best possible way to meet people is through parties. But I am not that type. I prefer to stay home despite my energy levels. I am very energetic and love to dance, entertain, and be funny. However, I was outcast for that energy in school. Despite the appreciation I got from family and my friends, most people never liked my energy. I don't want to sound like an incel, but my energy would have been described as charming if I was an attractive dude. But I am not that attractive, so it is just trying too hard, despite I am being my true self

Failure #7: Despite my grades, my education and skill development takes the highest importance in my life. I was taught that anything can be taken away from you but your education and your skill always remains with you. I prefer my time is spent on expanding perspectives. Though those were my values, I only recently started living them. I lived a lie till now. I believe in one thing and do opposite of that belief. I was a hypocrite. This maybe the biggest failure because I was cheating and lying to myself. I am against porn in reality. It is objectification and commodification of women and I do not support it. The ethics for porn maybe debatable but I am against it. Yet I am addicted to it. 

Failure #8: I am uncertain about future. I don't know what kind of job I will get. I don't know when I will get a job. I don't know when I will be establishing in life. I don't know if I am a good person or a bad person. I don't know if I'll successfully immigrate to Canada. I don't know if I will ever earn enough to own a house. I don't know if I will even reach six-figures before my thirtieth while my peers are most likely going to start with six-figures (computer science + internships + projects + high grades vs i don't know what major + bad grades + five years to complete degree instead of four). I live in fear. Fear that I will never be relevant. Fear that I will not be lucrative. Fear that I'll never be where I want to be. I don't just want to survive. I want to establish myself as a valid guy. And I have been failing myself to work hard enough for my goals.

I was never relevant. I was never desired. An outcast in school and a failure in first and second years of college.  But I am tired of my self-sabotaging. I don't want to be a failure. Yes, so far my life did not have any moments I appreciate, the defining moments. But that is because I failed to create an environment for them. 

Now, I decided to enjoy my journey. I may not have any defining moments in my life so far but now I take the step to create one. Though irrelevant in bigger picture, I am introducing you to something that I wanted to hear for so long:

Success #1: deleting accounts on pornography websites. As I said, it is not something big. But to me it is. I have taken control of my life. I have taken control of an extremely strong desire. Will I stick to it and never watch porn again? I don't know. But will I make an effort to not watch it? Yes. To me it is not just stopping a bad habit, it is building discipline and mindfulness. It is exercising willpower. It is practising honesty. It is living in congruence with my beliefs. And I guess those are the first steps for development. Honest feedback and consistent effort.

Success #2: Eating less and slowly. I used to wolf my food down and used to eat heaps. Now I chew each bute at least fifty times and I feel fuller on only 20% of how much I actually eat. Again, this might be irrelevant, but it is discipline and conscious effort to slow down. 

I may not have any more to add. But there will be. Because now I don't want material success. I want to live according to what I believe and be true to myself. Every time I do something which is in congruence with my belief, it is a success. Every time I put effort, it is a success. Whether I reach a goal or not is exactly in my control. But the effort is. And my character is. I want to be a better person especially towards myself. Whether a girl likes me or not for my beliefs, it's not my responsibility. I have my priorities in life. And whether my peers consider me relevant or not is also not my responsibility. Because I am relevant to myself. I value my education, my skills and my character. I will put any amount of effort for that. 

I want to be a guy who has his house neatly arranged, eats out less often and cooks his own food (I make delicious food), who does things way before deadlines and is organized and disciplined in life. I am 20 still, but I value my future more than quick gratifications. Does not mean they are bad, but that is not me. I want to get back on my feet and do everything required for college and my career. I will give enough attention towards my health and wellness. I will give enough attention towards keeping my room and life organized. This is a small step but a big step. It is a step towards what I believe is freedom and self-awareness. For me, my discipline is freedom. The more disciplined I become, the less I live in clutches of unwanted stress in life.",bropill,1606883056,sayinedi,3,1,True,2020-12-01

Don’t let your insecurities and fears stop you from going after what you want,"I’ve been taking to this girl for a couple months and i wish i handled it in a different way. When i met her i wanted her to chase after me so i was playing games trying to be unavailable and cold. I used to watch alotta youtube videos on how to get women and red pill content so that’s where i got that chasing bullshit from. It works don’t get me wrong but fuck that. After a while i caught some feelings for her and shit been iffy ever since. I told her i be thinking bout her and we talked bout it and kissed her. Then on when i see her is kiss her goodbye. I started texting her a little more and all that. This past week she been acting iffy. Telling me to chill with her then not say anything and leave me on read. She gotta baby so i get shawty be busy but it’s like shit flipped and she playing the games. 

Basically what i’m saying is I wish i was just straight up on how i feel. I got my heartbroken last year so i stopped me from doing it but i wish i did. It’s feels like it was a too little to late and it hurts. I don’t want no one else. I try to talk to other women but it’s just not the same. Always go after what you want. Fuck all the tactics and games people try to teach and just do what you wanna do. Just do it in a confident manly way and you’ll be fine. Cause if you don’t you’ll be like me.

My depression is getting worse and I don’t know what to do.,"I felt terrible 2 weeks ago mainly because of school I had no motivation to do anything, nothing I did felt fun anymore, and then thanksgiving break came and I started to feel a little better but now as school has started again My depression is back. I used to be a straight A student but now I’m borderline failing in a lot of classes and each school day is spent sitting in my chair and waiting for everything to be over. ever since October I’ve had a 24/7 headache and the semester will be over by the 18th and my grades are super low. When my parents receive the report card I don’t know what they will think they’ll probably blame it on me being lazy and playing video games when that isn’t the reason at all, I don’t know what I will do I just feel like a burden to my teachers for not doing anything I’m writing this while I’m supposed to be doing work for ELA but I don’t feel like doing that or anything 
else for that matter and what makes this all worse is I don’t have anyone to talk to about this I feel like every emotion I’ve ever felt has been bottled up for years and I can’t take it anymore I don’t really have any friends and I don’t like talking to my parents either I just feel like I’ve hit rock bottom.

Need a virtual hug,"Hi everyone. 26M

Going through a rough time right now. My girlfriend of 4 months broke up with me because she said she didn't want a relationship, and less than a month later she's posting a picture of her new boyfriend.

I'm aware I may have been the side dude, but she asked me to go on a day trip, 4 hours away, to meet her best friend. I thought she cared more about me than that. I don't understand why she'd introduce me to a long time friend if she didn't care.

I'm not even mad at her. Just hurt. I really thought there was something special between us. Although, it may have been just on my part. I'm thankful that I've learned a lot about myself from this break up. Given how rough COVID has been for everyone, it could be worse.

Yo bros,"New here, and I felt like posting. Lately I've been dealing with stress I can't quite place. I recently quit my job where I was being exploited and lied to by a money-hungry boss running a nonprofit. I've been taking courses to get licensed to sell insurance, but every time I go to work on my coursework I end up procrastinating. I've been seeing a girl for the past couple weeks who's fantastic and vibes with me well, and it's been accompanied by a feeling of anxiety around it that is difficult to place my finger on. For a while, unrelated to anything mentioned, I've been dealing with compulsive physical self-harm. Maybe a month ago I realized I could be doing serious long-term damage to myself so I've been working hard to stop, and it's been hard because I still feel that tension come up constantly.

While I can't place what's causing me stress, if I let myself babble what comes out is a deep-seated feeling of being undeserving of things going well. Maybe I'm used to being a piece of shit and unconsciously I want to remain in a troubled position. It's hard because I feel very alone and it's hard to understand one's own self. And right now I guess I feel like a little kid again who wants to punish himself for being a disgusting influence on the world, and I don't want to be that. There's just little support.

When I reach the tip of the blade, I aim it into the dent at a 45 degree angle and then a 90 degree angle. Once the skin breaks, I saw into the cut, back and forth, until I can't take it anymore, but my pain resistance has gotten better over the years. I feel really guilty cause it never feels like enough, I always feel like I could be going deeper, or that I'm just pretending to self-harm.

Moved to a new city a few months ago and I don’t think it’s going super well,"Hey all.
I’m not really a poster on this sub, but seems decent enough. I guess I need to get some stuff off my chest. 

I moved to a new city north of my Home town 5 months ago to attend a university to finish my degree. I moved into this huge converted frat house with lots of roommates hoping to make friends while at school. Well COVID happened and I decided to just work and wait it out. At first it was ok, I met a ton of new people and went to a few parties. And these people I was meeting, I was sure I was going to make solid friends with them given some time. But as time moved on I felt more and more lonely and ignored. Nothing really stuck with them. Conversations felt awkward or forced. So I just slowly recoiled. 

I just can’t shake this feeling of being lame and deeply uninteresting. Now I just wander back and forth from work, wondering if anyone will ever give a shit I exist. 

I’m not hopeless, just sad and confused and deeply attention starved. Did I fuck up somehow?

Keeping a major medical issue a secret from my wife,"Something happened a couple of days ago.

Long story short: I was really tired for a few days for no reason, workout at the gym left me way more winded than usual, and then that morning I went almost completely blind for about an hour. At first I mistook it for snow-blindness but I was only looking out the window for a few seconds, and after 5 minutes of not being able to read anything properly it was clear something else was going on.

When it went away I had a splitting headache all afternoon. Head was kind of sore for a couple of days after but my energy level came right back up to normal.

In retrospect - that's a blood clot. And it was somewhere around my brain.

Here's the issue: my father-in-law has begun the slow and laborious process of dying. Kidneys are failing, liver is swelling, he can't eat or drink properly... you know where this is going. 

My uncle and my grandmother both passed away over the last few years and in both cases it was such a slow, painful, god-obviously-can't-exist-if-this-is-happening process that it was a relief when they finally died. Well, now it's my father-in-law's turn and it looks like it's going to be a long and horrific process for him too.

So my wife has enough to deal with. I don't need to worry her about my health on top of things.

I know it's an irresponsible attitude but I don't know what else to do. I'm too afraid to freak her out and add to her already high stress, especially if it turns out to be an entirely isolated incident. So maybe I just watch what I eat, keep up the cardio, and I'll be okay.

Hey Bros! Back into the dating fray but very insecure about being out of it for more than half a decade,"Hey Broskis!

Straight into it:

Well, met this girl online, and we're having really nice and deep conversations and of we've seen of each other we find each other very attractive, which has been very openly said by both of us. We had video dates  and what not, and we talk every day and all is flowing well. Because of the UK lockdown we haven't been able to meet in person yet, as she lives relatively far away. 

Well, so far so good, but the reality is that a part of me is panicking because of my insecurities, because I just dragged myself out of a depression just this last year and because I've haven't much touched another human being sexually in more than half a decade and even before that it was few and far between. And the last time I actually was with someone that was sexually and emotional my type was more than 10 years ago, so that adds to anxiety. 

So, TLDR, met a girl online that is very cool and she is very upfront about thinking i'm attractive, I'm deathly anxious of meeting her in person and just being too awkward in person and if we get to that point, ""underperforming"" sexually.

Lately I have been thinking about the future of us as humans and our planet alot. It has alqays been on my mind that we are going downhill fast, but lately it has become dominant in my mind. I am talking about global warming, the increasing shortage of drinkable water, the potential extinion of the bees and all life on earth with them. The neglect the mass suffering of animals we tprture daily for our hamburgers. We as humans don't like seeing it so we stray away from that very real and dark present and future. We can't do anything anyways, and the people who can won't. They only want to sell more oil, meat, whatever and get even more obscene amounts of money instead of helping humanity not die off.

Is what happened to me abuse?,"So... this has been on my mind for the past six months.

I was in 8th grade (now in 9th) and had recently had my one and only ever gf taken away by overprotective/manipulative parents. It broke my heart, this was the first time I had ever gotten a hug outside of my family or even just felt cared about. Cishet male culture is incredibly toxic and makes boys not care about each other and think everything close to affection is ""gay"". Because of this forced break up, I had taken to self harm throughout the beginning of the school year.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we were a couple months into the school year, when this girl (ill call her ellie, not her real name) showed up in class. She seemed pretty nice and when i patted her head (it was a stupid thing i did to tease people because I was both socially awkward and tall) she actually liked it, something i didnt think ever existed. We make mutual friends, and after talking for a while every night or so she calls me up and starts telling me her sexual fantasies. We had not talked about sex shit outside of jokes up until this point. I, being a horny male teen, was quite happy about this and she mentioned me as someone she would want to fulfill those fantasies with. I asked her to come to a park before school with me, to which she agreed, but after asking I immediately regretted ever thinking about it. It just felt... gross i dont know how else to explain it. Because I was not comfortable with her I didnt back out and we did some sexual stuff, during which i felt sick and grossed out by the whole thing. We awkwardly hung out (despite me trying to get some space) throughout the day, never ended up doing anything else sexual either that day or down the line. A day or two later I have kids coming up to me asking ""what did u do with ellie?"" and other, rumor based questions. I tried to handle it all but it was rough on me. 

Then some of ellie's and i's closer friends came to confront me, accusing me of abuse. I have always had horrible self esteem, but I still knew that she had been ok with everything we did. These friends told me that ellie had told them about what we did, and told them that she was abused (she didnt elaborate past that). I felt horrible, thinking I had hurt her. We all had a falling out, but somehow ellie and i still were ok friends. She seemed to have my best intrests in mind, and I came to her when I was feeling shitty. However, whenever I came to her she would tell me how much worse other peoples problems were. She also very pointedly told me that she had faked all the noises during what we did, which did kinda hurt me considering it seemed targeted to hurt me not to make me better. She continued to spread rumors, tell me bad things about myself, boast about her new boyfriend non stop, and otherwise try to hurt me. She often came to me with drama talking about horrible things in her life, and I listened and tried to help. But as opposed to saying it wasnt something she needed help with or that I couldnt really do anything, she called me useless and lazy and other such things. She continued this type of stuff, during which I attempted suicide due to feeling useless and self harmed a lot, until we got into an argument and she blocked me. I sent screenshots to a friend trying to get them to text her, and they replied telling me she was manipulating me. After looking back on everything she did, despite what my self hatred told me, I felt like I had been intentionally hurt by her. 

other friends came to me apologizing of siding with her in arguments, and showed me screenshots of her trying to hurt them using things they knew to be untrue about herself (she was boasting about things either she didnt do or others did for her).

I know it doesnt sound bad laid out like this, but I could see she intentionally caused rifts in our friend group leading to many heated fights, boasted when others were down in order to hurt them, lied about abuse to get sympathy, convinced me that I was a horrible person and that she was perfect and that my problems were meaningless, and didnt even stop what im fairly sure she was consciously doing after I told her about my attempt. Its quite late and there are almost certainly things i didnt mention but this is just something I felt I had to ask. Was I abused by her? Did I abuse her?",bropill,1605090071,cloneguyancom,29,1,True,2020-11-11
Why do people think shaming or self-hatred is appropriate to improve?,"I never understood this. Why cannot you love yourself and try to improve? Many psychologists suggest to be self-compassionate and not be too hard on yourself. And being honest, after my therapy sessions, my grades and body improved exponentially because I started being more self-compassionate and self-loving. My mental health improved and I appreciate it whenever I reach a goal. But every other Reddit post I see supports shaming others for their habits. Especially when it comes to weight/substance-abuse. Why do many people think shaming is appropriate to improve? Isn't it only detrimental because it messes with your mind and makes you fall into a negative thinking loophole?

I never understand the obsession with shaming others and yourself. Even some fitness YouTubers (like Greg Doucette) completely behave like assholes in the name of telling you the ""truth"". Sure, being overweight increases the risk of a myriad of illnesses, but you don't really need to shame others by saying they look like garbage, poop, etc. Or people looking down on drug addicts. They have a problem already and you are not making it any better by shaming them. Many already suffer from a mental illness (primarily substance-abuse) and are struggling. I feel that they need to be dealt with more empathetically and in a way that does not disturb their mental health.

P.S.: I am not telling people should be more compassionate. It is ideal to be of course. But there are Psychologists who go through rigorous training for years telling that shaming/self-hatred is not ideal. If people cannot be compassionate and helpful, they can at least be indifferent is my strong opinion.",bropill,1605119688,sayinedi,3,1,True,2020-11-11
update from last night:,"I need to thank you all for what you said in my previous post about the toxic relationship I went through. To clear some things up, I haven't talked to ellie in several months because I knew it was unhealthy for me. I've also cleared things up with some of the people she turned against me, and they are realizing that they were also manipulated by her, and we are becoming good friends. I've also managed to get a boyfriend, I have only been able to see him once since quarantine (hes the small guy in the picture) but talking with him has been wonderful, and hes helped a lot since he was at school with me when all the bad shit with ellie happened. Its been hard to talk with him considering my parents are somewhat homophobic and transphobic (hes trans) and not aware of my relation to him or my sexuality, but talking over the phone has still been wonderful. I really got what i needed to hear from you all last night, and i cannot thank you enough.

I'm quite unrelateable to anyone I know,"First off, I am in highschool, so obviously as I go to college I'll find someone with similar interests, especially since many classes/departments are made to suit specific studies. One of the problems I've come across, is that my interests and hobbies are not things that the average person is familiar with, and I feel as if this prevents me from ever finding anyone with things common with me, aka, somebody I could potentially date. Everybody has different interests, obviously, and you can't expect someone to have all of your interests at the top of their priorities in the same order, but the first step is to find something you share in common, then slowly discover and learn about eachothers interests.

Problem #1: Like stated above, my interests/hobbies aren't super mainstream. For example, I know 2 people (no girls) that like metal, 2 people (no girls) that like jazz, I know no one that likes post-tonal music (thats pretty expected honestly), I know no one that likes math rock, I know no one that likes neo-funk/jazz-funk, I know 1 person (no girls) who likes worldbuilding, I know no one that likes conlanging, I know no one that likes linguistics, I know no one who likes sociology, I know no one who likes urban planning, I know few people who like history (1 girl thats been a friend for a long time and thats likely not going to change), I know no one that is into leftism (again, expected), I know no one that likes philosophy, I know 1 person that is into geopolitics (same girl as above she's pretty awesome but we're not going to date). Clearly, reddit has been quite helpful in providing me communities to talk and learn about these things lmao 

Problem #2: Obviously I can't expect people to have all of the same interests as me. So I am friends with people that don't share interests with me: A lot of my friends like video games, I don't, but its still interesting to have conversation with them. Of the girls that have ever been interested in me, it really seems like they just want to hear me talk, they don't have any feedback, ever. Those people are suuuuuper boring and I have to carry every, single, conversation. Of the girls that can actually have interesting conversations and have things to say, in my experience, they're gay. That's fine, I can't change anything about it, but I've found that straight girls are boring as hell. I live in highly heteronormative midwestern suburbia, so it might be that it takes someone who isn't straight to be interested beyond what is happening in school, but I'm kinda pulling that out of my ass. Thats what I found most often, people are all talking about the test tomorrow but nobody gives a shit about war crimes in the middle east. I don't care about school that much, but I'm privileged in saying that since I've never had a tough time in school. 

I don't why I made this, this mostly just a vent. I hope you guys are having a great day!",bropill,1605127427,angriguru,5,1,True,2020-11-11
Need some solidarity in reacting to a girl's behavior,"Here's a quick summary about me - 23M, struggles with social anxiety among other mental health issues, unable to make friends and transitively zero progress with the opposite sex.

Earlier this year, before the virus hit, I met a girl in my grad class who just happened to sit next to me. As many of you so often quip, I faked it, and I made it. It, being the interaction. I spoke to her and she reacted positively, and I had a human conversation with someone in a very long time.

Once the university shut down and classes went online, one day she just messaged me out of the blue nowhere, just to chat. You have no idea how big of a deal this can feel like to someone like me.

Despite forming an instant crush on her, I recognized the infatuation as me just clinging on to anyone who just shows me the slightest bit of attention. After all, I barely knew her. She seemed like a nice person nonetheless, and I genuinely wanted to be her friend.

We texted more and more, but she soon revealed a very annoying habit. She would often abruptly stop responding in the middle of a conversation and take forever to respond. By forever, I mean upto two or three weeks. She always reached back out with an explanation that she was busy. As a desperate fellow with no one to talk to, I would pathetically look at her profile to check her ""Last Seen"", and saw that she was online all the time she claimed to be busy.

The internet told me that I was not entitled to anyone's time or responses, so I never brought it up. I just joked about it once that it would have been easier to communicate via homing pigeons and she fucking laughed with me.

Often at times, I felt like one of those guys in the neckbeard memes, or those r/niceguy posts when I observed my thoughts whenever I was thinking about why she was not responding to me. Fuck that. I was not going to let the internet tell me that I should feel bad about myself.

The more this happened, the more fed up I got, and I stopped responding enthusiastically to her. I would just answer her questions point blank and leave no room for conversation. She was not making me a priority, but I did not want to change my behavior because of her. I like to be a decent person and respond to people's texts or atleast take the two seconds to let them know I will be responding late.

And now that I am 'ignoring' her, she has suddenly been texting me more. She even asked and called me the other day, and under the pretext of asking me about the classes for next semester made conversation with me. She mentioned how we talked about getting some ice cream, or watching a movie and never got around to it. I was this close to yelling at her that I asked her twice and she said she was busy - asking a third time would make me feel like a creep, and honestly, if she wanted to hang out she should have fucking asked me!

I can't explain to you how fucking infuriating it is. I tried being the best version of myself and got ignored. I distance myself from her and suddenly my attention is in such demand. I try my best to not believe that ""Girls go behind jerks and the nice guys get left behind"". I really do. And again, I'm not trying to get into her pants. Literally just tried to be her friend. 

Why the fuck are people like this? Why does human interaction have to be so fucking convoluted? Why can't making friends be as simple as responding to niceness with niceness? Oh no - games must be played and tests must be passed for me to be shown that I am worth valuing as a human being.",bropill,1605141806,onestepatatimeman,20,1,True,2020-11-11
"I’m conflicted, bros.","Hey bros. I did a scary thing today: I broke up with a girl. I’m not very assertive, especially in matters of heart, so it’s kind of a big deal for me. I don’t know how to feel.

We’ve been texting each other since March, and it was really good for many months. Recently though, she pretty much quit texting me back, and so even though she wasn’t properly ghosting me, I felt abandoned and unimportant. I explained that it was causing me to struggle to stay happy, and asked her for increased emotional intimacy, but she replied that she was taxing herself too much to text me back every day, and that she didn’t have the interest or energy for increased intimacy (her own mental health reasons). 

That really hurt, bros. I’m housebound from COVID (and terminal cancer, but that’s not really the issue here), and I struggle with the loneliness and isolation. What’s worse is that we met though mutual best friends — they all went to the same high school, and I met our mutual friends in college — so while I’m not completely without a support system, it’s complicated because I’m afraid I can’t vent my feelings honestly to my best friends. 

I sat on it for a few days, unable to decide if I wanted to go on a break (her preference) or break up entirely (my preference). I put it to her that I wanted to break up, and she understood. We talked just a little bit more about what went wrong between us, and when she expressed a hope to remain friends, and I said that I would like that after an appropriate healing period — and no promises made. 

Bros, this was like two hours ago, and I’m already wracked with regret. I’m doubting myself, hard. When she ghosted me, I would wait by the phone and simmer, resenting her and desiring her with equal measure. Now I’m afraid that I actually would have been strong enough to go on a break and that I just threw away my last chance at romance (bc cancer). At the same time, I’m afraid that is we hadn’t broken up, I would have just repeated the same cycle of simmering waiting for her to warm up again.

I think I chose right. I think I’m just confusing the pain of separation with the pain of choosing wrongly. I hate that I hurt her with our breakdown of communication months ago, but also that I hurt her by choosing myself. I’m so frustrated, but I don’t think she and I can ever get to where we wanted to be. I feel like we both let each other down. 

I don’t know if I want advice or comfort, I just feel like I need another human to know what’s up tonight. I broke my own heart trying to save it. Hope you bros can forgive another crypost. I love you bros.",bropill,1605144050,radE8r,6,1,True,2020-11-11
Girl I've been pursuing for a year just told me I'm unattractive,"I'm a 19 year old guy. So, yesterday evening she wanted to go on a run to help cope  while getting over her ex bf. I'm not nearly as fit as she is, and on a full stomach whilst being dehydrated, I really was only able to run a quarter of what her ability was. Well, while we were running in the dark, one of a group of 3 guys in an adjacent parking lot shouted ""Hey baby!"" And I didn't respond because I knew if these guys were pieces of shit, they wouldn't think twice to jump me and possibly assault her if I pissed them off. She got upset after the run, which went a lot shorter than she wanted. She pointed out that I wasn't fit enough to take care of her, and she wants a man who will stand up for her. Even if I was fit, 3 guys jumping me, possibly armed, I probably wouldn't be able to fight them off. She just made me feel really bad. I figured, it's just street smart to not say stupid things to stupid people, at stupid times, in stupid places. That's how stupid things happen.",bropill,1605196408,Tardviking,118,1,True,2020-11-12
I Broke Down Crying In Class Today.,"I’m very ashamed but I guess I couldn’t encase the distress for much longer. In the middle of class, dazed and distracted, I suppose I just remembered how much pain and anguish I had been put through. I was sorting out my e-mails and came across some months-old ones of concerned teachers, wondering if I was alright and why I wasn’t responding to anyone.

And I guess I just lost it. This persona of a tough but upbeat guy who didn’t show his weaknesses felt like a facade after all this time. Maybe I hadn’t truly gotten better. After all, I was experiencing the same feelings of despair and hopelessness that I had years ago. And I’m ashamed that I broke that character in front of people I barely knew and hated, I didn’t mean to.

You are all very compassionate people, so I thought that I would share it here. I’m not sure what my thing with coming off as strong or whatever is but I cried in front of people I didn’t want to again. I was crying during writing this then my younger brother stormed in and interrupted. I’m depressed. My clinical depression is getting to me.

How do I feel better about my sex life?,"I know questions of this sort have been asked many times over, but please bear with me. 

I am 23 and I have had a non-existent sex life. I have been in bed with only one girl and it was not a great experience - I met her off a dating app. We did not even have penetrative sex. Miraculously, she has been the only person to ever swipe right on me in my history of using dating apps. I have since deleted dating apps to improve my mental health. 

I am working on myself though - I am working out, I have a therapist for my mental health issues, I'm indulging in my hobbies etc,. Focusing on myself pretty much. 

Being pretty much a virgin at 23 is making me feel really bad about myself. I want to have sex like everyone else too. I have sexual desires too. I have never experienced female attraction in my life - sexual, romantic or platonic. 

It does not help when I am told ""sex is overrated"" because I would rather come to that conclusion on my own after having had the experience. 

It does not help when I am told ""virginity is a social construct"" because despite the time frame I still do not receive female attraction.

Similarly it does not help when I am told ""sex does not define you"" or other similar stuff. 

I want to seem attractive to women. I want to be able to flirt with them. I want to have casual sex. I want to have a FwB. I want to have intimate sex with a woman I love. I think it is OK to want these things but tell me if it is not. 

Apart from working on myself, what can I tell myself to overcome the way I feel about this? I have heard that repeating affirmative thoughts can help this sort of stuff.",bropill,1605221698,onestepatatimeman,1,1,True,2020-11-12
Finding a job in a new country,"Hey bros, first off, I'm not sure if I'm just using this as a place to vent or what but hopefully someone can offer some advice.

Bit of backstory: I moved from the UK to the US because my fiance lives here and we closed the gap after doing long distance for a couple of years. We're in Texas and it's taken a lot for me to get adjusted to the american way of living. 

I used to work in the biomedical device industry and I was super lucky landing the job that I did. I don't have a degree and am worried I won't be blessed with the same luck ever again. 

It's been nearly 8 months since I arrived in the US and my work permit has finally come through. Throughout this time I've found myself getting pretty down due to the dramatic change in my lifestyle, i.e from working and being able to afford rent in my own place to relying solely on my wife and her income. Combining that with missing my family and friends a lot has not made my first year in the US very enjoyable (or as enjoyable as COVID would allow).

Now the time has come for me to look for a job. I've always suffered from imposter syndrome in whichever job I have done. My last job was fairly niche and involved basic coding and working with large datasets. It was pretty complicated at times but I had a great team that would always help with anything I was struggling with. 

I'm trying to write up a new CV and I'm worried that I don't have a lot of transferrable skills or the requirements to land any decent jobs. I'm also at a complete loss for what jobs to even search for. 

Does anyone have any advice for low self esteem when it comes to applying for jobs/writing a resume?

I need some help bros. Can you please help me figure this out?,"I just was having some thoughts, primarily caused by my insecurities and felt that I do not deserve love, empathy, or affection. I don't know what I battled with but I went through therapy had to stop because of travelling. But I truly believe that I do not deserve love, empathy or affection. It is because it is others' choice to make, not mine. Whether I find love or not is not just dependent on me. I can do everything right and still end up alone. Even empathy, people may or may not want to give you. I feel that being dependent on others for love, empathy and affection is unhelpful. People need space and I cannot always get the same affection they once gave. I think I should completely focus my life on myself and myself only. I mean, I am very vocal on social issues. But I only do that for my satisfaction. At the end of the day, I will sleep better when I know I did something for people. I want to become completely independent emotionally. Because emotional labour can take up people's mental energy and untrained ones burn out. 

My friends always listen to me vent, which I do a lot. But I believe that it will take a mental toll on them too. And they will reach a point when they can no longer do it. I really don't know why, but I think we are alone, at least emotionally. I want to work on building the necessary empathy, affection and love for myself so that I don't need external support. I find journaling helped me, but I still whine a lot. I am always researching on ways to be more acknowledging and accepting to myself. I want to grow into a person for whom external love, empathy and affection is not a requirement. We need people for many other things, no questioning that. But emotionally, I want to be able to be alone without feeling bad sorry for myself. I also feel that things love is not long lasting and it fades away with time. I feel very difficult to trust people emotionally. 

I think the majority of my thoughts come out because I am a very whiny and grumpy person. I really want to change that because it is a matter of time before people will leave you. No one wants to be around whiny and grumpy people. Especially because I am still 20 and majority of the people of my age are active and cheerful. I don't want to want love, empathy and affection because I am almost always whining about it. I am so complaining, I believe that my friends and family have eternal patience. But I should stop this kind of nonsense behavior and keep my feelings to myself. I want to stop making my feelings public. At least to the extent I do. 

I have never been on a date and right now contemplating to never be on one. Until I feel that people are no longer a need, but a luxury, I will not date. I do not want to be dependent on people for love, empathy and affection, especially validation of my emotions. People do not owe me anything, and I want to live that way. No one owes me anything. Not a single person. And I want to be emotionally independent. 

I want help in being that way. I want strategies to become emotionally independent, stop complaining and whining, and be self-satisfied emotionally. Please help me bros.",bropill,1605386518,sayinedi,9,1,True,2020-11-14
I just don't know what to do.,"I am just so sick of always being the responsible one. Since I was a teenager I was always the person in my family comforted the others.

I often defended him in front of my parents, and when my mother started crying because he and my dad were fighting I was the one who tried to cheer her up. And still, they treaded me like the immature one because, well I was (and still am) the youngest one, and because I wasn't as interested in politics and the stock market and shit like that, at least not as much as they were. And I realized that this Problem has extended to my friendships as well. Don't get me wrong my friends are great and take care of me when they notice that I am hurting, but the vast majority of the time I am still the one lifting them up and not the other way around.

Feeling anxious about something a little silly,"I'm 19 in college and where I live and in my hometown snapchat is pretty much the main form of communication between people. Now i have never really properly ""done"" snapchat or social media in general so I don't really talk on it.

This is really silly but it's getting me down because i'm thinking about whether or not I'm missing out on being closer with certain people because I can't text or snap anyone.

About my insecurities and different flight response,"Hello bros of any kind, I have a few problems, most of them have answers that I can find myself, but these are the ones I'm stuck on. Any kind of help is appreciated.

1. I have a weird flight response. Generally I go headfirst into new things as long as I know I'll be mostly unharmed, but whenever a girl looks into my eyes and if I notice, I kick into primal fear and GTFO mode, leaving ASAP without any grace. I know the reason of the reaction in base form, sadly impossible to stop it from happening all together with CBT (therapy version) or any other therapy (primal reaction hardwired into brain), but there is no answer to what I should do other than exposure therapy.
2. I know that I look good enough to trigger the halo effect as long as I throw an iota of care to my clothing. Even with this life changing perk, I still believe that I don't look that great. I know that my face has right proportions, I'm in the 95th percentile of height in the world (6'3"" ish, near 190 cm), I'm not super overweight (no overhanging gut or under developed muscle mass for height and weight); but can't use self affirmation because it feels nothing more than dishonest delusion and can't believe and internally accept almost any praise about anything I didn't put effort for.
3. Lack of desire to chase for a relationship. I think I am some kind of an asexual, but there is still possibility of me just denying my lack of effort and disguising it as my personality to escape from responsibility. Even increasing my sexual drive with gym did not help for me to chase any kind of relationship with girls within my socializing areas, even stepping into acquaintance zone and moving from there.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Problems of mine without answers:

1. Fear caused by eye contact with girls in close proximity
2. Not believing in myself, looks based
3. Lack of desire bordering asexuality",bropill,1605400502,Yeet-over-everything,3,1,True,2020-11-14
I don't know what I should do with myself,"Hey bros it's as the title says. I'm in highschool currently and all of my time there hasn't been great. I think it's because of everything that has been building up throughout my life. I will quickly explain. 

My childhood left me with very shitty social skills, started developing my apathy and mess it very hard to express any kind of emotion. I also started to have big issues with low self-esteem because of being obese. In this state I went to a new school, where I met my ex.

I wanted to stay friends, but I knew her good enough to know, that she would be gone if I refused. During our relationship I did some shitty things, like guilt tripping her when she would cut herself and few worse things. The point is that after I looked back at what I did, even tho I didn't felt bad, I forced myself to keep away from people because I just couldn't take it anymore. 

Enter high school, where from start to present I didn't spoke to anyone in school. Even my bro was out of my life for a while. During this time, I had zero meaningful interactions with another human. I got much thinner thinking I would feel better, but honestly it's the same if not worse. After this thing got so bad, that now every time I even think about talking to someone expect my bro, I can't control my breath and I start to shiver. That's where alcohol comes in. 

I can't legally drink in my country yet, but with my appearance, they sell it to me in most places. Because of that, I started running away to it whenever I feel sad or lonely. But it also helped me talk to someone I wanted to for a long time. This leaves me with doubt if it was a good decision. I'm scared of texting most of the time. I think I'm not either funny and really boring if I'm not drunk.  

This whole quarantine made me think much more, that's why I want to ask you bros about your opinion.

Do you have any advice on how to get back to just being able to have a conversation and working on loving myself?",bropill,1605411271,JokerIsFake,3,1,True,2020-11-14

Was I molested as a child?,"Hi all.

For the past couple of weeks, I've been thinking a lot about my past. My grandpa hitting me, father screaming at me, calling the police, suicide attempts, ect. But there's one memory that doesn't sit well with me, more so than the others, and I don't know why.  Compared to this memory, I'm at relative peace to my previous traumas. But this one just doesn't feel right and I don't know why. 

In first grade, there was this teacher who took particular interest in me, I don't know why.  Back then, I had anger issues and I was insecure about my constant bedwetting (I wouldn't stop bedwetting till middle school).  Perhaps it was the way I acted, perhaps it was her way of showing pity. This teacher in question was old and obese, perhaps this was more normal in her day.

I remember, one time, while she was reading a story to the class, she halted suddenly and told me to come sit on her lap. I didn't want to, but she was holding up the class so I felt obligated to go. When I sat upon her lap, she wrapped her arm around my waist. I hated it. I wanted to be as far away from there as possible. I wanted to cry, but I knew that if I cried she would ask what's wrong and I didn't want to say. So I just waited till it was over. 

Another time, while we were at a assembly or something similar, this teacher came up from behind me and started to rub my shoulders. We were both standing up, for context. Again, I hated it, but I didn't the heart to tell her that I didn't like it, because of how kind she was to me.

Lastly, this memory is a bit more vivid. It was the end of the day. At the end of the day, all the kids got into a single file line to leave through the door. I got ready last, so I was last in line. As the line walked out the door, the teacher stopped me. Once everyone had left, she kissed me on the cheek. It was very surprising to me because I wasn't expecting her to do that. It made me feel fiercely  uncomfortable. Since I lived close to school, I walked home myself thinking about what had happened. I must have been distressed, because mama asked me what's wrong and I said nothing.

These are the instances I remember most clearly. Actually, I had forgotten about this whole piece of my life, I had forgotten I even had a teacher like this until I began a depressive episode a couple weeks ago and remembered it suddenly when I was thinking about having sex with a woman. I remember it now, if vaguely. I recall that everytime I had been touched, my whole body froze. I couldn't move, or speak. I just shut down. When I'm highly stressed - I still do.

I know for a fact I was never raped, nor asked to take off my or her clothes, she never touched my genitals nor I her's. So am I making a mountain out of a molehill here? Was this just some general unpleasantness kids feel when old people touch them or was this molestation? I can't tell. I just remember not liking it.

I looked at the current staff of my old school online. The teacher doesn't work there anymore. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if she was dead by now, like I said she was old and obese.

"Ended my first relationship at the age of 19, after two months.","I have a mix of emotions, first some disappointment and also some relief. It felt kinda good being in one, she took an interest to me first as we are on the same university course and it was kinda convenient. She was great we always had great deep convos on the world and in general on different topics, whether that be messaging or irl in dates. This was all a new experience to me, I had never been on a date before and it all kinda happened naturally to me, as in she randomly popped up into my dms. Btw i'm moderately attractive guy - i barely go to the gym especially with covid, and my height is 5'8 (not bad at all imo, people overthink this). She was way outta my league, and this isn't on some incel shit either, just stating a few things all guys think. 

Anyway, when it came to the first date my flatmate told me take it easy and just act like I was talking to a friend, which I did and it went great, she took me to her fav dumpling, and bubble tea place. Btw she is Bengali and I am Pakistani, both from the UK. That went on for around 2 months, we were busy sometimes and we would talk about work a lot, but in the end it was a conflict of schedules and what not and working. But also, most importantly, whilst she was super funny and nice, I felt like I was going out with her for the sake of it because it was my first relationship. I think everyone reading this can learn from this. Everybody also probably gets tired of the cliche of not ""clicking"", but it's so true. It's not like we hated each other, quite the opposite, but something just wasn't there. Anyway, my friends were happy for me, I gained some confidence from the experience and obviously have no ill will against the girl.

Questioning my masculinity as a Trans guy,"(sorry if this has the wrong flair)

I came out as Transgender about 5 years ago but I haven't been able to start my transition due to my siblings' health being a priority, and now that my mum's been laid off, we're losing our health insurance for a while. I've never been super confident in myself, especially now though as I'm reaching adulthood and I'm still at Stage 1. I do my best to ease my dysphoria by flattening my chest, packing, and speaking in a lower voice, but I know that I'll never be seen as a real man.   
I have a classmate who is also FtM and is much further along than I am, and I'm very happy for him, however, I can't help but feel overwhelmingly jealous of not only him, but also other Trans people I see.

My family tries their best to be supportive; they respect my pronouns, call me by my correct name, look into support groups, etc etc, but no matter what anyone does, I still feel stuck. A few months back, my primary physician gave us a referral to a transition program at our local hospital, and I was so excited because I was promised that I could begin my transition journey, but now, my sisters have become the priority once again.

I don't know if I'll ever be able to start transitioning before I turn 18, and it's that milestone that I'm most scared for, because it's from 18 to 24 years of age that the body finishes development  and I don't know if it'll become for difficult for me to transition or not.

I don't know, I guess this was sort of a vent, I haven't seen my therapist in about 3 months now, and I've been meaning to make an appointment, but I never get the chance. Whatever, sorry this is long.",bropill,1605586960,ExtensionTrash,9,4,True,2020-11-16

I still hurt from a past relationship and I just don't feel understood by my friends.,"I think this will be a longer post. Really, don't feel obligated to read any of this.

Earlier this year I started dating this girl for a couple of months...and I really fell for her. In fact, it was the first time I have truly fallen in love in 8 years. However, once I stated her my feelings and that I wish to make it truly official (even though we already were exclusive) she said no. In her mind, she cannot say I love you to someone and be in a relationship with someone unless she can be sure, that she sees this person as her future husband. She also never had an actual relationship before, ever, even though she is ambitious, smart and beautiful, so guys probably just line up. She made subtle jokes about us being married in the time we were dating, so this of course hurt a lot. It's not like I was 100% sure that I wanted to marry her, but I definitely wanted to see where it leads. Also she just turned 21 (while I'm 25), so I am not too surprised she thinks this way maybe. She said that a relationship might be something she can give me in a couple of years, but not now. In the very same conversation however, she also said that she only wants us to be friends, but *never* more. Her definition of friends included sex and the special bond that we both share. 

This didn't just hurt, it absolutely crushed me. She definitely didn't want to say goodbye and hopes I reconsider or make her at least a small part of my life, but the thought of being non-exclusive friends with benefit disgusts me.

Now the thing is, yes I was in love with her. But it wasn't like the last time I felt love. I did not have crazy butterflies in my stomach or something. Instead, when I was with her, I finally felt home. I realized how desperately I was looking for this feeling and I never wanted to lose it again. It was the first time that I didn't just feel like we were in my apartment, but that we were in my home. I couldn't experience this feeling otherwise so far.

In the past, we moved a lot and I changed schools a lot as well (5 in total). There is no place for me I can truly call ""home"" or return to. I have very good friends, but they're scattered across the country. Also, it's not like a circle of friends that I have built from the ground up in a hometown. It's more like people I met along the way, that each have their roots somewhere, but I don't.

It's been half a year now and I still hurt, but I have stopped talking to my friends about it. They are compassionate, but I can see how they just don't understand how I am not over it, especially since it only lasted a couple months. They each grew up and live in the same place their entire lives, they have a support network and family they can always fall back on, they have a place they can truly call home. 

Losing this feeling that I briefly had, feels like such a deep and intimate pain. Not only that, but it's very embarassing being hung up on someone who probably doesn't even think about you anymore. Up until a month ago she still followed me on Spotify and I could sometimes see, that she listened to songs that she doesn't really like that much, but that I absolutely love from my own playlists. It made me a little happy, but it was dumb and unhealthy to read anything into it. I had to unfollow because seeing what she listens to all the time just wasn't a good idea and she suddenly unfollowed me a month ago.

I did all the things you are supposed to do in order to heal, honestly. I went to the gym, built (more) muscle, picked up a hobby and started to socialize more (within reason in these times), but nothing works. Also, when we were still dating I was stupid enough to set up one of her best friends with a good friend of mine. They're still in a very happy and I am happy for him, but it definitely makes me not want to spend time with him anymore.

On top of all this are of course different problems as well: finances, family issues, corona, studies being absolutely brutal, depression and anxiety which the medication don't seem to alleviate in any form, etc.

It's not even that I want to feel great, I just ask not to feel this absolutely awful anymore. Sorry for this wall of text, I will probably edit it a couple of times too.",bropill,1605641221,Avongrove,6,5,True,2020-11-17
Careers advice,"Bros, I’m 30. My job and career and what I want to be doing with my life aren’t where I want them to be. I have a great girlfriend and friends but they’re all teachers or in high end jobs and honestly have their lives together and I’m really proud of them, I’m kind of the odd one out. 

To be honest I never thought I’d make it this far. When I was at university I had really bad depression (it got pretty bad) and in some ways it stunted my growth in my late teens and early 20’s meaning I wasn’t as mature as I should have been or wanted to be.
That’s for me to deal with and I am. 

But because of it I never focused on after university, career wise. How do you go about deciding what you want to do with your life. I totally get that  it’s not something you can just jump to, it can take years to get there but I just want to know how you decided to do what you wanted to do with your life because honestly I’m finding it pretty tough because of it. Currently work as a supervisor in a hardware store and don’t get me wrong I like my colleagues and stuff it’s just not where I want to be.

How to deal with the emotional roller coaster that is dating?,"Hey bros :)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really have a lot of experience dating. I just kind of ignored it for most of my 20s, and now that I feel like I could be a catch and ready for a relationship, I am really struggling with all the emotional ups and downs that come with dating.

Like once I start texting with someone I met on tinder for example, I immediately become extremely emotionally attached to whoever I'm talking to and have issues focusing on anything else. I'll anxiously check my phone every 5 minutes and get sad until they responded. 

And when something doesn't work out, it'll send me down a deep depression...

It's a real emotional roller coaster. Usually my emotions are quite grounded, but whenever romance comes into play it feels like I regress into the emotional state of a 14 year old.

Does anyone have some advice for me? Thank you!!!",bropill,1605722426,Heavy_Diamond8751,14,5,True,2020-11-18

I make music and have a girlfriend. 

Few months ago my girlfriend and I were driving and she told me about her friend that sang songs, and she suggested that I make a song with her. 

I said an admittedly weird sort of thing like ""Well she's not really an artist"", and I know how cringe and pretentious that sounds but I just meant that she sang cover songs whereas I was interested in creating original music, not as an insult to her. 

Then my girlfriend said ""well you're not really an artist either..."" and I just said that I didn't mean to insult her and tried to explain it. But that statement has lingered with me for I think a pretty long time now.

I don't think ""being an artist"" is some grand idea, I don't think it makes me special, I just identify with that term because I create art (music). My girlfriend has lived with me for almost 2 of the 4 years we've been together. I make music 80% of my free time. So it's not that she doesn't see me creating art. So I guess that word has a different definition.

It made me really question my identity. And how even the people closest to me view me. And I think since that I've felt really sort of stupid about making music. Which is kind of sad because it's been a part of my identity and life for over a decade. 

I've never really needed to make my music popular. I've always been satisfied just making music and putting it on bandcamp for like ten listeners. 

But since she made that remark I feel like I need more in order to appear successful to her and other people. Like I can't be considered a real artist unless I have a million views on spotify or something. 

Then I started thinking, well, none of my friends really support what I do. My own girlfriend doesn't listen to the music I put out. She said my fucking album was too expensive, it was THREE FUCKING DOLLARS!!! For shit I put hours of work into. My one friend paid $10. 

So I guess I just make shitty music. And that's completely fine. But can I at least be respected for doing something with my time that's creative and enjoyable, instead of trying to make me feel embarrassed that I haven't retired off of ambient techno yet? 

Oh yeah let me add more context for you too, I make more money than anyone I fucking know so what's up with that? Plus none of these people literally have had a hobby in their lives, it's fucking ridiculous. Television and social media type people.

Hell of a month and it’s not even over," Hey bros, I’m a bro in training and I just kinda want to talk about the hell of a month I’ve had. Early this month I broke up with my girlfriend, and I’ve been doing some self reflection and talking to my friends and apparently I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. I’m glad I got out of it but it’s pretty awful to find out that the person I loved very deeply did not love me back the same way. My grandpa also died, I wasn’t close to him but it’s been really stressing my dad out and I want to be there for him. And I also might have COVID, haven’t tested positive yet my friend has it and I saw them right before they tested positive so I’m feeling really stupid right now. I might be starting therapy at some point which sounds nice but I’m nervous. Probably can’t get it right now if i test positive, but I’m hoping things will get better at some point.",bropill,1605759531,Fangirlhasnoreality,5,1,True,2020-11-18
"Dearest Bros, I've been having a bit of an emotional crisis and I need some help.","Both parties here were 26 at the time, my girlfriend is currently 27, coming up on a year together. I apologize in advance, this is a pretty long one so thank you in advance to anyone who reads the whole thing and shares their thoughts.

My girlfriend who I love to no end had an intense breakdown shortly before Halloween. She had suddenly seem very stressed out when we were talking on the phone, hyperventilating, couldn't talk, and hung up. When I was able to get back in contact with her, she seemed calmer, and I picked her up to come over to my place. We were cuddling and hanging out on the couch when she suddenly started hyperventilating again, so I held her and asked what was going on, but she seemed unable to talk.

&amp;#x200B;

She calmed back down eventually and we talked about other things, but anytime I asked what was going on she started hyperventilating. or would go quiet, but seemed unable to talk about it.  I found out shed barely slept the last couple of nights, and she didn't end up getting much if any sleep that night either. What followed was honestly very traumatic.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day was similar for a while, kinda ok but clearly something was bothering her that she wasn't able to talk about. Before anyone jumps to conclusions, it wasn't cheating or anything like that, and it definitely wasn't pregnancy because she was on her period. Her parents, her roommates and I pieced things together after and it seemed to be a combination of money trouble from a bunch of unexpected costs, not wanting to burden me with her problems, and residual trauma from some events that occurred last year. On top of this, I had convinced her to see a therapist, she was finally able to get an appointment but had to wait a month to go in, and when she finally did they rejected her AT THE FRONT DESK WHILE SHE WAS CHECKING IN, saying the therapist was busy and they'll just schedule a virtual appointment for another time. A month of fucking waiting and they pull this bullshit on someone who's already vulnerable. It makes me angry just thinking about it. She's one of the kindest, most big hearted, caring and loving people I've ever met, she deserves so much better than that. Back on track though.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was saying, the next day. She wasn't talking and it was freaking out more and I started having a panic attack. I calmed down some, went outside, called my mom who helped me calm down more. I came back up, apologized for panicking, and told her I wouldn't push her on what had happened but I was here for her if she wanted me for anything and laid down on the couch. She eventually came and joined me, things seemed ok, except for a brief moment where she seemed paranoid that I was filming her which stood out to me even then. Eventually I fell asleep and woke up to hear her firmly saying ""No,"" about what I'm still not sure, and saw her grabbing her backpack and bolting out the door. This was 3 am, she didn't live in walking distance of my place or have her car at my place, and had been distressed earlier so obviously I bolted up and out the door after her. I tried to talk to her but she just stared at me with this intense, suspicious look and kept walking. I followed her, carefully trying to balance coaxing the woman I love who's clearly not in her right mind back inside to keep her safe while this is happening, and not looking like a man forcing a woman to go somewhere. Eventually I was able to get her to come back. I barely slept because I couldn't know she wasn't going to do that again and she wouldn't sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

The third day was much worse. I could barely get her to eat, she would hardly talk at all, didn't seem to really mentally be there at all though I would get hints, she would tap me on the leg if she wanted me to keep hugging her or stay near her, and actually did briefly snap out of it to make sure I was ok when I started having another panic attack, but quickly reverted. I needed back up so my sister came over to at least support me trying to support her. My sister stayed with her while I called her parents down in the courtyard and explained the situation as best I could. We decided they should drive up the next day to come see her because this was clearly above my pay grade. Eventually my sister left and that night was more of the same, I was slowly cracking, crying a lot. I put on one of my favorite episodes of The Good Place  to help myself relax (Season 4 Episode 6 if anyone's curious, has one of my all time favorite quotes ""what matters isn’t if people are good or bad. What matters is, if they’re trying to be better today than they were yesterday,"" but I digress) and told her that it had helped me a lot when I was a having a hard time in the past. This actually piqued her interest and she eventually sat down with me and was asking me questions which made me hopeful, but eventually after the episode she reverted back into herself again. Throughout the day she kept saying things like ""I can go"" or "" You should go"" but wouldn't explain, I asked her why and made sure to tell her I didn't mind her being at my apartment, I just wanted to be there for her, I was able to get her to come lay down in bed with me eventually, but I could tell she still didn't sleep much if at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fourth day was even worse. She seemed even more out of it, and at one point before her parents got there I saw her lift up her hand from between her legs with blood on it. She hadn't changed her tampon in I don't know how long and was bleeding through her yoga pants a good bit. It was heartbreaking to see. Her parents got there, we were able to get her to go have lunch at a food truck nearby. She made a small inside joke to me about something I said on the way there, but that was really it as far as lucid moments went. Eventually after lunch I went for a walk to give them some space hoping she could talk to them more easily without me there, but from talking to them after it sounds like she wasn't talking much still and what she did say didn't make sense. They took her back to our hometown (we grew up in the same place), my sister came to stay with me after everything, and I headed back to stay with my parents nearby the next day once I had some sleep in me.

&amp;#x200B;

They took her to a psychiatric hospital to get assessed, and they ended up taking her as inpatient on an involuntary hold. It's now been over two weeks. I've talked to her on the phone a couple times, but she didn't sound good and kinda pushed me off the phone last time and sounded suspicious of me which was really hard to hear, and I haven't heard back from her since, though I've intermittently dropped off love notes and some hand drawn cards to let her know I'm here for her. She'll potentially come home tomorrow, but the hospital has been horrible at communicating with her parents even though they have medical power of attorney at the moment, which gives me a bad vibe about the place, and means I don't even know if that will actually happen.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what to do bros, I'm scared for her, scared for myself, scared for the future I saw with her, the kids we had talked about having, how she'll feel about me when she gets out, I love her so much. I've never been with someone who made me feel so understood, appreciated and held before and the wait and silence are killing me, I feel like I'm in limbo. I've spent the last couple of weeks crying on and off at my parents house. I just want her to be ok and I feel lost.",bropill,1605776644,KookaB,3,1,True,2020-11-19

Bombing my senior year of high school,"I just don’t care anymore 


I’ve never been too smart I have spent most of my life as a B student who took a few honors classes

It’s just this year I literally could not care less. My parents are pissed at me all the time for having almost straight Fs. And my awful SAT score really shows the way things have been going. 

On top of that my calculus teacher might be the most insane asshole I have ever had as a teacher and he is making my life miserable. I straight up stopped doing his homework and caring about what he wants

I spend most days just waiting for the weekend cause I just want to smoke weed with my friends but the week has gotten so fucking hard

Thinking about her makes me oddly sad. I'm 19 now btw. One day she just disappeared and that was that. I hope she and her birds are doing well. I think she'd be 20 or 21 now. She's one of the first people I actually connected with.

Ask For Consent.,"Bros,

I am 22 years old, living in the United States. I have been with 35 women, a shallow thing to track, yes. The majority of those encounters were passed age 20, while living in Texas. 

Gentleman, I have asked pretty much every single one of those women for consent prior to our first encounter (often times, last), then follow it by adding, "".. and if you would like to stop at anytime, I'm not going to hold it against you.""

It has never, ever resulted in a negative outcome for me. If a woman wants to sleep with you, this will not likely turn them off at all. They're always appreciative and I feel like it's fantastic if you don't have much capacity for smooth talk. Shoot, ask to kiss her, she'll think it's cute. Ask if you can reach down into her pants, she'll think it's sexy. Alternatively, ask you not to, but who wants to physically engage with a woman who's not wanting the same thing?

Not my bros, I know that. 

I love you all.",bropill,1605840231,johnnyaclownboy,58,1,True,2020-11-19

Anybody here with any experience on this stuff?,"[16M] I want to start working out and getting a little more movement into my life. Up until this point I've lived a pretty much exclusively sedetary lifestyle and while it didn't bother me before, now that online school is going on my cardio has completely gone out the window.

The thing is, I have a lot of things that make me afraid of adding workouts to my daily routine. My posture isn't the greatest, and while I am working on it slowly, people are saying you should go into exercise with good posture or I might face some problems down the road. 

The main thing stopping me though is my hair. From what I understand testosterone increases balding heavily and from what I understand working out increases your testosterone too. The fact that I'm 16 and my temples are already going to town makes me worried. I don't wanna go full on bald at 20 just because I wanted to get more fit.

I generally do not experience the usual worries of people my age, as I have good grades and I will most likely get into a good college should I choose to do so. The problem is, my parents are straight-up Fascists. They indoctrinated me into their hateful ideology when I was a young kid. Thankfully, I got out around 2-3 years ago, particularly with the help of a girl who I will refer to as C. Now, C is a really nice person, and she convinced me of the obvious fact that Fascism is bad and helped me find a new way of thinking. Only problem is, i've ended up distancing myself from everybody and everything and I have only wanted to speak to C. I only meet C twice a week, and she has been talking to me less and less. With her slowly drifting away, I feel as though I have nothing left, as speaking to her was literally the only thing that made me happy. I know that I need to find new people to speak to, but most of the people in my school suck. I have hobbies, but I only see them as a way to pass the time, not something to live for. I spoke about my issues with C, and she told me to come here. I want to improve and meet new people but I don't know how to do that anymore.",bropill,1605886617,Chesist,7,1,True,2020-11-20

There are 1000 ways to be a transman. The toxic standard of Styles, David Bowie and all these - ""Be thin, white, and look feminine"" doesn't mean we're unworthy if we don't fit.

Do I have trauma ?/recovering from abusive ex,"hey bros.  16yo male here.  Obligatory I used to be obsessed with mysoginistic redpill shit after going through my first breakup, and realized it was just a womanhating incel larp circlejerk after a few months.  Right when 2020 began though I started going out with a girl.  And this was a girl that I had the fattest crush on.  Like, this was the most attractive girl I had ever seen in my life.  But you know what they say I guess, every red flag just looks like a flag when you're wearing rose colored goggles.  

we only dated for 2 months or so before i got the f out of there.  but she was a very sexual person.   
 much more sexual than I am.  and whenever she would want to do some sexy stuff, i already have a somewhat unusually low sex drive for someone of my sex and my age, so i would tell her no.  and she would ask again.  to which i would respond with no again.  and then she would ask again like 8 more times, every time i would say no, until she hit me with the ""okay well then I guess you think im ugly"" and i was like damn okay fine.  but it was always just felt wrong.  and I never enjoyed it.  I don't want to say black out, because I remember whenever it would happen, but my mind was definitely never there in the moment.  The first time it happened I remember making out and doing other stuff but I was just kind of staring off into space like a robot and not really engaging, almost like I was trying to ignore the reality of what was happening.  And it always felt super uncomfortable and cringey.  And I just felt embarrassed, and used, and less human whenever it would be over. 

I was always doing things to her too, I never let her do things to me, I would always find a reason to not let her, but probably because it was just easier for me to hunker down, do something to her, not complain, and just be done with it.  It got to the point where she would want to do things over facetime.  And I had strong objections against this.  But she didn't care.  And I was too oblivious at the time to realize i was being manipulated and put my foot down.  And I was never into it at all, and i feel bad about this because it's really dishonest, but after 20 minutes or so i would just get tired of it and i would pretend to nut just because I wanted it to be over.  

I don't feel like going into other things she did, this is probably the worst of it, but you get the idea I think.  She was very controlling, toxic, manipulative with me.  It was only 2 months but it felt like so much longer than that.  And when I broke up with her she started going around spreading rumors about me with her friends saying how small my dick was.  how abusive I am.  That kind of stuff.  I didn't say anything back though or bad mouth her at all because I just felt sad.  And it's just immature.  And I'm actually really proud of how I handled the situation.  I don't want to sound like I'm above anyone or like an iamverysmart type person or anything, but I seriously do feel like I have a more developed moral compass than other kids my age.  

My problem though is that I used to be open to the idea of dating most people, and I've noticed that after that experience, I kind of just assume anyone I talk to is crazy until proven otherwise.  And I'm not open to dating people as much anymore, because I feel like most people I date my age are just going to be more interested in using me for emotional gain or just wanting the fantasy experience of a relationship instead of actually wanting to build something real.  Is this trauma or is this growth?  And if it trauma, then how do I go about moving past this?   And (obviously) I have no intention of dating around right now due to corona, I just mean in general, i am much more averse to the idea of dating than I used to be.",bropill,1605898140,highschoolgirlfriend,17,1,True,2020-11-20
Should I lose my virginity to an escort?,"This is something that I have been considering lately as a 23 year old virgin. I know that it's something that is a turnoff for a lot of women, and I feel like I'm going to disappoint who ever I end up dating or sleeping with due to my inexperience. Like there's this girl I've been talking to recently who told me that she wanted to get high and have sex with me. Obviously I didn't turn down that offer and we even setup a day to hang out, but when the day came I started to question if whether I should tell her I'm a virgin or not. I knew that she would realize anyways so they're really was no way of hiding that. I got so nervous I just called it off, the worst part is that that wasnt the first time something like that has happened to me.

So after this last time, I started looking into just paying an escort and getting it over with.

Trouble with starting a new job and changing routine,"Hey bros,

I started a new job this week after being in the same place on the same schedule for quite some time. Where I was felt like a dead end, so it needed to be done and I think it will be better long term for me.

However, I have a lot of trouble with change. I'm on a very different and not yet consistent schedule, and the anxiety I'm feeling about it is constant and feels suffocating. I'm totally unable to relax when I get home, it really feels all encompassing. Added to the general anxiousness around information overload and a new environment, and the fact I'm working opposites to my wife and haven't seen her much this week, I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed and on the brink of collapsing under it.

I don't want that anxiety to be the stumbling block that stops me from excelling and moving forward. It has been crippling many times before and caused me to miss out on opportunities or self-sabatoge, and I'm sick of that and truly want to do better. I keep trying to tell myself it's all temporary and I'll eventually adjust and be comfortable, but it's tough to internalize.

Just found this subreddit and I already love you all. And for those that need to hear it: you’re not alone.,"I love the positivity, lack of judgement, and beautiful outlook on masculinity here. It makes me happy to see men who feel “left behind”, so to speak, realize that they’re not alone. 

I’ve felt “left behind” before; like I had to handle all my own problems competently, brush off criticism like it didn’t matter, have all the right answers, all the while never getting help or recognition. What a fallacy. 

Somehow (I couldn’t tell you how), after a while I started to get better at just listening to people. And people love talking about themselves, so I’d just listen and ask follow-up questions. 

I started noticing people getting a little bit happier when they talked about things they liked, or a bit of relief when they could complain — things I’d never noticed before. 

When people were comfortable in conversation it gave me a lot more confidence, and I started to pick up on vocal/physical hints of excitement, admiration, and even romantic interest. I also started to realize when people just did not want to talk to me, and finally I had the grace to not take it personally. Maybe they’re just tired or introverted and don’t actually hate me.

"Today, I looked in the mirror, and felt great.","I haven't posted on here before, but I've been a lurker for a while.

I usually give off the appearance of having confidence. Verbally, I always have, but as soon as my body comes into question, I crumple under pressure. I loved and still do love swimming. Water makes me feel super comfortable, but the issue is being on the deck/shore and being shirtless. I haven't gone swimming at my local pool in 2 years because the thought of taking off my shirt makes me so nervous.

This evening I was bored, so I watched my favorite comedian and listened to music I really like. While I was still in a good mood, I went to take a shower. I was amazed. I took my shirt off, and whispered *""Damn! I'm attractive!""* and did cartoonish poses in the mirror. I still weigh the same, I still have the same haircut and color, I have even more acne than normal, yet I felt like one. hot. man. 

I always logically knew that attractiveness is subjective, but I have never experienced it like this. I learned that doing something I love can change the way I perceive myself for the better. The more I do things I don't enjoy, the more I try to force myself to do things I hate, the uglier I feel. There is nothing objective about attractiveness. It sometimes feels good to tell yourself that because it gives yourself a goal. However, the goal shouldn't be an attractive body, but a happy soul.

Not everyone can afford to do the things they love, but if you want to be attractive, do the things that make you happiest.

I am privileged in saying this because I do not have depression, but I understand that depression can make it very difficult to find enjoyment in what you do. I hope you find something that makes you happy. I'm rooting for you :D",bropill,1603684580,angriguru,7,1,True,2020-10-25

My emotions are a huge clusterfuck after meeting a cute guy and I have no idea what to do,"Dear Bros, I have to get this of my chest. Any advice or input at all is \*greatly\* appreciated. I don't know what to do anymore.

In mid July I broke up with my boyfriend of four and a half years. I was super sad for about two months but managed to distract myself, so in September I actually stopped thinking about him.

Then, I worked at a festival for 4 days, where I worked with a really cute guy. There was nothing to do, so we talked a lot and it was really fun. I didn't feel a super special connection or anything but he was nice. Afterwards we stayed in touch and met up twice. These were amazing. We had so much fun just chatting about anything and everything. I also felt super comfortable around him from the beginning on, which is really rare for me. Both times he paid for my drink, which led me to suspect this was getting kinda romantic, but everything else felt 100% platonic. Over the weeks when we met up I developed sort of a crush on him. It wasn't deep or anything but all I could think about was kissing him.  We also had a sort of deadline because he was moving to London and his train ticket expired on September 30th.

After our second get-together thing, he walked me home and kissed me (very passionately, might I add). He said ""I'm glad I did that, before leaving for London"".  We met again the next day (which was the day he had to leave) and spent the whole day together. At first we were switching between kind of hanging out platonically and making out, then (a bit through my initiation) we just lied there cuddling, and again making out occasionally, for some time. I told him I didn't know how ready I was for a relationship, as it was very soon after my breakup and he told me not to worry, because he wasn't ready for a commited relationship either, after his breakup. He also wanted to sleep with me but I didn't feel ready for multiple reasons, so we didn't. I walked him to the train station and he kissed me goodbye. That was the last time I saw him, almost a month ago.

Then the really confusing shit went down.  I was still crushing on him hard and we texted each other memes but no solid conversations. Then I asked him if we could talk about the nature of our relationship (not in the sense of romantic relationship but general relationship between two humans), since ""not committed"" can mean literally anything. He then texted me that I misunderstood him, that texting and hanging out was fine, but he wasn't ready for any relationship at all. So I told him that it's absolutely fine, we'll just keep this platonic, kinda sad but whatever. Then he said no, he wasn't comfortable with that either. That confused the hell out of me and kinda scared me too, because I mainly care about hanging out with him, romantic or platonic. So I told him, I'll stop texting him, and he can text me when he feels ready. After three days of not texting back he finally told me the word ""relationship"" scared the shit out of him and even ""platonic relationship"" sounded too much like a promise to him so he thought no contact would be the right thing to do. But he really enjoys hearing from me, so texting is fine. So I'm like ""platonic it is, then"" but I added, that I developed a mini crush on him but he shouldn't take it serious, because I surely wasn't gonna and I just wanted to tell him so I wouldn't feel like I was hiding something. The he answered that I'm a super cool woman but he just doesn't feel that way.

Now that just confused me further. I really want to take what he says serious and take no for an answer but like, \*he\* kissed \*me\*. He bought me drinks. We spent an entire day making out and cuddling. He wanted to sleep with me. He clearly is (or at least was) attracted to me, even if he doesn't have a full crush. So why did he phrase it like that? My theory is, to encourage me to get over him because he can't and doesn't want to promise anything.

So I thought, if we were platonic and he doesn't have a crush on me, he might be comfortable meeting with me (as friends). Two weeks after that whole ordeal I asked him if he wanted to hang out and he said he needed space for himself, but we could meet up around Christmas. That also does not sound terribly platonic.

&amp;#x200B;

So much for what happened. This started an emotional roller coaster. I can't stop thinking about him, I switch between ""This is too complicated and I don't even miss him that much, I don't really need him"" to ""god he's so cute, I don't mind waiting or having no contact, I'm fine admiring from afar"" to ""I need a relationship so bad! I just wanna cuddle and stare into his eyes for hours"" to ""why doesn't he love me???"" to ""I need to sleep with him now, no matter the cost"" to ""oh god I don't want a relationship, especially not if he lives so far away"". At first this changed every couple of hours, now I've calmed down a little and I only completely change mood every couple of days. But additionally, I started missing my ex again, though I have no idea if I miss him or the relationship we had before it went bad and we broke up. I'm sad and I don't know which aspect of this is making me sad, or if it even is this whole thing. I have quite some issues of my own and there are 15 billion other things, that might upset me currently, it's impossible to tell. Additionally, I'm starting to forget the details of our meet ups, so I don't actually remember if it was as great as I think it was but I remember thinking it was super fun back then. So my attraction to him is shifting dangerously towards ""he's great in my imagination, so he must be irl too""

I can't stop imagining how our next hang out will go down. I keep hoping he will tell me how much he missed me and move it into a romantic direction. It might happen but it also might not. I'm worried I focus to much on the romantic possibility and I will be disappointed when it's platonic. Also my crush on him is getting deep. Deeper than I'd like. I don't even know him that well and I am starting to forget what he looked and sounded like. But I want to get to know him so badly. I text him almost every day and he always texts me back. He never seems annoyed and we had some good (very brief) conversations. He never texts me first and I'm worried I'm too much but I also just get overenthusiastic with these things. he told me he's not great at texting back and I can accept that. I told him I might be overzealous, so it should be fine.

I thought about whether I should try to get over him but there's some issues.

1. There's a decent possibility we're gonna be romantic and I don't want to get over him, only for him to want me but I don't want him anymore. And it's ""just"" two months until we see each other again, so I might be able to ride this out without my crush getting overwhelming. But then again, it is already overwhelming.
2. The internet says, to get over your crush you need to talk to him and figure out if he's as great as you imagined him (most likely he isn't). I wan't nothing more than to do just that. But I can't really until Christmas. Another website said the complete opposite, that I should cease all contact with him. But we will meet again, so I don't want to randomly ghost him out of nowhere. And I don't want to tell him I want to stop talking to him for a while, because I don't want to discourage him from texting me or make him feel bad and make him think twice about keeping in contact with me in general

I wan't to know what's gonna happen  in December so bad but it's so far away. I wanna know how he feels, but I'm pretty sure he doesn't know either.

I think that was all. I'm sorry for the length and the rambling but there truly is no way to communicate the clusterfuck that is my emotions in any cohesive way. What should I do? What can I do? I feel extremely emotional and overwhelmed all the time and I don't know how much longer I can do this. But also how would I get it to stop?

Can someone suggest or help me find a suitable weight lifting program?,"Hey guys - I'm going to hit the gym, hoping to finish the year on a high. I am 23 years old, but I have the physique of a 13 year old.

I am also skinny fat with love handles bulging out awkwardly on my otherwise thin frame. I used to run long distance in high school before I stopped abruptly in college, resulting in this.

I have thin, skinny wrists - the kind people like to form a ring around and hold up to tease. I have very little strength throughout my body.

This means that the exercises I find on many beginner's weightlifting programs are still too difficult for me. For example, I can't do a single bench-press rep even with an empty bar with the weights removed. I can't do a single pull up.

Other exercises, like the lat pulldown machine - I can barely do 5-6 reps before I'm gassed on the first set. So, there's no way for me to make it to 3 sets of 10 reps.

I would have asked the bodybuilding and weightlifting subreddits, but they are not well geared for weak beginners, and the resources they have all lead to ""beginner programs"" that have exercises too difficult for me.

Any advice please?",bropill,1603736119,onestepatatimeman,10,1,True,2020-10-26

"Dear Bros, remember this.","I've recently discovered this and helped me wrap my head around the unnecessary pressures I put on myself.

1. If you have absolute control over it, you do not need to worry. You need to do things that will help you achieve the desired results. For example, you have control over what you eat and how much you eat, what you study and how much you study, etc. 
2. If you have some/no control over it, you do not need to worry about it again. You do things that will help you achieve the desired results. For example, you have no control over an exam difficulty, or you have no control over who likes you. But you influence the result by studying well/covering all bases or be a good, friendly, and supportive human. (Does not mean cheating in an exam or negging/coercion!!!) 

Remember bros, there is no shame in failing or getting rejected. There is nothing bad about feeling bad. But what you do about it is definitely a deciding factor. You can either move on or harm the person who rejected you/ someone who hurt you. You can either learn from your mistakes or self-harm. Take help, take care of yourself. And never apologize for it, or feel weak about it. And you do not want to have someone who doesn't want you and does not want to lose someone who cares about you. Eat well, sleep well, exercise, be in touch with your emotions, talk to people, journal, whatever works for you, but take care of yourself. And stop stressing about things you have no control over! At the end of the day, you, your health, and your goals should be your topmost priority.",bropill,1603861912,sayinedi,11,1,True,2020-10-27

I (21) have recently started my first proper job (I say proper because I was working at a sawmill for a day or two a week for the past few months). It's a traffic management job so it's handy enough work (except when you get some people that get really pissed off at you and hold up traffic or when I don't know the area well enough to redirect people) but it's a long and boring job, always up at like 5 or 6am and never knowing when I'll be home (sometimes it can be after 7)

She has expressed that she finds me attractive and last night said she loved me. I'm very attracted to her and we have great chemistry, but I'm worried by two things:

1. Given the circumstances, even though I know I'm chill and will remain her buddy even if she turns me down, asking her out still puts her in the position of breaking her only buddy's heart, and that sucks and complicates her giving me a straight answer.

2. Speaking of straight, she's heterosexual and I'm not a guy. (I'm nonbinary, but was assigned male.) She did say offhand that she includes enbies in her affections once.

Number 1 makes me feel like I should wait until she has a broader support network, and number 2 makes me worry that the green flags she has given me might have just been like, a straight girl being encouraging, not flirting.

I don't know if I can keep up with my studies.,"I've recently started pursuing a masters program in IT on the side of my IT job and I'm seriously struggling to find the motivation to stick with it.

I mostly started because of pressure from my parents (my dad calling me at least once a week and asking when I will finally get a masters degree) and because I thought it would open some doors for working internationally.

It's two months into the program now, and with working part-time and then Uni in the evenings, it's draining my life energy. I would much rather spend some time applying myself creatively, taking dance and art classes (as far as the pandemic allows), but I do not have the time during most of the week and then on my days off I'm either supposed to study or I'm just too exhausted to get off the couch.

Everyone says that it's only a two year program and I should just stick it out, but honestly it's making me lose interest in both my job AND the degree. It's just so much sitting in front of a PC being productive in the eyes of capitalism and there's like a million things I would rather do.

I need some help bros,"Hello bros. I needed some help and found this to be my safe space. 

So here is the thing:

I spend a lot of time in progressive spaces and try to broaden my perspective on various matters. In fact, I am a very vocal feminist and an LGBTQ+ ally. But, I have some values that might be considered prude or ""backward"". And sometimes I feel that I am bad or something. Because many blame deep-rooted misogynistic ideas on these values. They are:

1. **I want to have a career with an upward slope.**  I want to do something meaningful. I have a dream to go to Law School. I want to earn enough to not worry about money. But most importantly I want to stand up for my values. However, I feel that supporting corporate culture is shamed by progressive people. I know that corporate is corrupt and is detrimental to progress. I know that they exploit the workers. But unfortunately, we do not have an alternative.  I want to make sure that neither my future family nor I have an unstable lifestyle. But the progressive community makes me feel guilty for wanting a stable life. Or at least I feel that way. Am I bad for wanting to use the present system to progress? If anyone of you watches Brooklyn 99, do you remember the episode ""Moo Moo""? The one where Terry Crews is racially profiled. In that episode, Captain Holt advises Sergeant Jeffords to rise to power and create change. For Sergeant Jeffords, there is Captain Holt to support. But there is no one for me to do that. And I have to follow the path that Captain Holt did. That is my argument. Rise to a position where you can change the system. Is that a fair argument?
2. **I want a monogamous relationship.** Again, I feel like being shamed for wanting to marry, as many believe it is a system to oppress women. This value actually has constant shaming from the progressive community. If people from the LGBTQ+ community want a monogamous relationship, is that oppressive too? I believe that a monogamous relationship is between two *equal* individuals, regardless of sexuality. I believe that my desire for monogamy stems from familiarity and a strong connection with one person. No matter how many close friends you have, there is that one friend with whom you connect the most. And that level of familiarity has something to do with stability. And this is my argument. Is that a fair argument?

I might be feeling like a victim. I might be wrong. But, the stability that a good career brings, the mental peace that a strong friendship and emotional connection bring, and the happiness of having a person that is the most important in your life with whom you share everything is something that makes me feel safe. I wanted to broaden and understand if I really am wrong, or that my choices and preferences are justified and valid. I have stated my reasons for why I want those, so please let me know any other arguments.",bropill,1604054706,sayinedi,42,1,True,2020-10-30
How to deal with mutual hangouts after a break up.,"What's up bros?  I'm having a bit of a hard time lately.  My girl and I broke up recently, it wasn't horrible, but it was very peaceful either.  My issue is we have a mutual friend group, we both know this group outside of each other so it's not like 1 of us introduced the other to the group.  She's closer to some of them than I am, but I'm closer to some of them then she is.  I saw her for the first time in a few weeks a couple of weeks ago, I tried to talk to her privately but she wasn't having it at the time due to a girlfriend of hers being there and she didn't want to leave her alone.  We talked for about a minute before she turned around after her friend asked her a question.  I had been drinking a little bit and made it awkward by standing there waiting for her to turn around so we could finish our conversation, that never happened and she called me a few days later to yell at me about making it weird and to ask me to just 'be normal'.  I tried to explain that I had some things I needed to get off my chest and just wanted that opportunity but she wasn't hearing it.

That ended with her hanging up on me, I tried to call her right back twice but went straight to voicemail both times.  I was driving around since I don't like to just walk around the house when on the phone, she tried to call me back a few times a few minutes later, but I ignored them because I was pissed off that she hung up on me.  I eventually call her back hoping she's calmed down enough to let me talk as she just kept interrupting me when I tried to speak, but she just yells at me some more about ignoring her calls and hangs up again.

My issue now is our friend group, I've been hanging out with them during this entire pandemic deal almost every weekend, but now I'm not sure what to do.  Should I keep hanging out with them and just ignore her or should I fall back and just let them be?",bropill,1604089463,Tdrive1300,7,1,True,2020-10-30

"Hey bros, My little sister made a national volleyball team!!!!!! I’m so proud!!!!","Hey bros, this probably doesn’t belong here but I needed to tell someone and who better than other bros. She’s only in 8th grade and she made a national club team!!!!!! I’m so proud of her. As an athlete myself who watched her work so hard day in and day out it was amazing to see her burst through out garage door and scream “I MADE NATIONALS!!!!” after getting something she’d been so tirelessly chasing. And she’s only played the sport for like a year and a half. I guess it goes to show how far hard work will get you. She will get to travel to places across the US and play some of the best in the country. I know this is short and not very important compared to other things I’ve seen posted but I’m just so excited for her and I needed to tell someone which I guess is what this sub is for. I’m gonna keep pushing her to be the best she can be and to anyone who has played on national teams like this and have any advice please let me know.

How Do I Accept My Height?,"I’m a 15 year old guy who is transgender (not on hormones/had surgery yet) and I’m starting to think, maybe, I won’t grow much taller.

Looking for some advice about how to deal with loneliness and work,"Hi Bros ! 

I've been lurking on this sub for quite a while, and I love this community because you guys are so accepting and kind :) so I thought that if one day I was having doubts or bad moments, it wouldn't be a bad idea to try and reach out here. And I think that I could use some advice now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm French, and as you may have heard, we're having a second lockdown over here. Except it's not as strict as the first one, and most schools are staying open, while universities are closing down. I'm in college, but my studies are a bit peculiar : unlike most college level courses in France, we don't have our classes in universities, but in high schools. Which means that I'm going back to school on Monday, since high schools are open.

Now I have to admit I'm sort of scared, because I'll be far away from my family (I live on my own in a pretty big city because of my studies), I won't get to see them until this lockdown is over, and plus my studies necessit a ton of work (I work every day of the week from 8am to 11pm, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) is the wikipedia page describing my studies to get a better idea), and it's the first year i'm away from my family. Plus i gotta be careful with the virus, because i'd rather not get sick. I'm also living in a pretty small room, out of which I won't be able to go very often. So I guess what I'm currently wondering is how the hell do I stay sane while being alone in my small room, while having to work during every waking hour of my day ? (even though I like what I study, I can't imagine it'll be easy). Have you guys experienced something like this before ? If any of you have advice on how I can deal with this, I'd be really grateful.

Thanks a lot in advance and have a good day !!

I had to work through the one holiday I care about,"So, bros, Halloween is the only holiday I actually care about. Thanksgiving and Christmas are always intensely stressful, and there's nothing else my family celebrates.  But Halloween is one of the few holidays I've seized for myself. I was looking forward to finishing a cosplay I had worked hard on all year and sitting around a campfire with my brother and a few close friends. 

But I work night shift at a new seasonal job. Twelve hours straight. Four days a week. Thursday through Sunday.  We get Christmas off, and maybe even Thanksgiving, but I could care less.

I just saw another dude wearing his costume of the same character on another sub, and I'm sad I don't get to do the same.

I am extremely fed up and helpless with the present scenarios,"Hello bros! For the past few months, or over a year, I have been quite fed up. While my mental health did improve a lot and I am very confident in my life, I am very fed up with how things are currently run. There are several aspects which always bothers me, and I am helpless in doing anything about it. A little background, I am an Indian (20M) studying undergrad in Canada. So here are the things which irritate me:

1. **The declining/unstable economy:** The choices that the older generations made are affecting us now. Whether Indian or Canadian, the economies of most countries are now unstable. It is not just the pandemic that affected but they have been on a decline. Companies are hypocritical in hiring. We need the experience to get a job and a job to get experience. How does anyone think that works? I am born into a wealthy family and can afford to do unpaid internships and get relevant experiences. But what about people who cannot afford to do that? I feel the commodification of humans is extremely deterrent to the economy. Anything is built on the effort of humans and they are the ones who have zero value in the market. That is topped by income disparities. While the middle- and working-class people lost their livelihoods, we have billionaires who have increased their wealth disproportionately. And we are not going to question it because ""they earned it."" How did they earn it? Through the collective effort of the employees and management. And there is nothing *I* can do about it. 
2. **The commodification of Basic Human Needs:** Nutritious food, clean drinking water, a decent house, healthcare, and education are basic human needs. This might not be true in all countries, but if you are aware of what Nestle does, you will probably understand that commodification of basic human needs is real. Again, I am privileged enough to have access to all of them. But what about people who cannot? And the worst thing is many people support this commodification. In fact, one of their arguments is this can bring about new technologies and understanding. But humans have been creating despite all this. When we feel the usage of something, humans are bound to make something out of it. 
   1. A subpoint to this is the commodification of relationships: Dating apps basically do that. While I am not on any of such platforms, I am sure they will destroy my self-esteem. The media created an environment where a relationship is a commodity. Something that you own. Not something that is built between two or more people who are actively trying to improve, grow together, and express their feelings healthily. The fact that a human is just a picture, just their body is too shallow. Some people might have had success in dating apps, but again, it is reducing a human's value to meer pictures on a mobile phone. 
3. **Unhealthy levels of competition:** This builds on the economy, but there is another component to it. We are programmed from childhood to give unhealthy importance to only certain aspects of life, especially career. Everyone is pit against each other where they are not backing off from cut-throat strategies. Co-operation is what made humans successful. But that very skill is lacking nowadays. This leads to antisocial and psychopathic individuals to be rewarded, while the ones willing to co-operate are left behind. Not only career but looks are also extremely emphasized. I cannot remember the last time I accepted my body. I am overweight and actively trying to lose weight. But there is this kind of conditioning, this can be personal and due to my age, that without being certain things you are not worth it. I appreciate that pushing people to present themselves well, look after their careers are something good to do. But we are placing so much emphasis on them, that someone who does not meet some criterion (in my case a chiseled body which is difficult because I naturally carry more fat and a Computer Science job, which I hate with my full heart), you are not worth it. As I said, some of it may be personal, and something only I might be feeling.
4. **Unstable politics with violence and lack of social mobility:** In India, many people are lynching those who talk against the government. Caste-based violence and rapes have sky-rocketed under the present right-wing government. In Canada, the Province Premier has cut 11000 healthcare jobs and actively trying to privatize a very good public health sector. He cut funding to education and many staff members are getting laid off. All over the world, women are being discriminated against, their bodily autonomy is being stripped off, and there is targeted violence towards minorities. And what are people doing about it? A guy I went to school with abused me for posting something against the Indian government. Many young adults are brainwashed by right-wingers leading to hatred and intolerance. Many politicians are resorting to violent strategies to win elections (US, India). People are not questioning or raising their voice. But I understand them. I can talk, voice my opinions, and question even if it means putting my life at risk. But sometimes, it can get to my family. No one wants that. 
5. **Too much power in too few hands:** I cannot emphasize the level of power the US has. It has involved in too many wards, made violence rampant in certain areas. That's not to say the US is inherently bad. But if you are on the bad side of the US, your country is most likely going to suffer. And there is no one to question them. Not just the US, but many US-based corporations too. FAANG companies are literally owning countries. They are disrupting elections, privacy, and basic humanity. Who is there to question them? Who is regulating them? 

I know that many people might have the same concerns. And I know many are actively questioning. But I believe we have created an environment that is hostile to people's health. And this is not a movie for me to do something heroic. I cannot do anything alone. And every time I talk about this, everyone from my family to friends tries to change the topic. Because these are uncomfortable truths that no one wants to discuss. I am privileged to have access to all of these, but I care about people around me. Especially the ones who do not have access to them.

I am extremely sorry for the long post, but I had to vent it out somewhere. I thought this is a community that would support me and validates my feelings. 

Tl;dr: I feel helpless and fed up with the things going around in the world, and those are: 

1. Declining/unstable economy
2. The commodification of basic human needs and relationships
3. Unhealthy levels of competition
4. Instability/violence in politics
5. Too much power in too few hands",bropill,1604505262,sayinedi,8,1,True,2020-11-04

How do I identify my goals?,"Hey everyone - I need some help from some of you who are more experienced with life, but anyone who has anything of value to add should feel free to chime in. 

I am having trouble with the question of ""What I want?"". A few months back, I began my self-improvement journey with some seriousness. This included various mental health issues as well. 

One of the many facets of this plan involves writing down clear and defined goals for the short term and long term. 

Short term goals have been easy. Finish reading ___ book. Learn and practice photography. Finish ___ certification. 

However, I am having trouble with my long term goals. I don't really know what I want to do. I spent nearly the last decade not cultivating any skills or interests at all. I am a grad student in tech, and will soon be entering the workforce full time. After asking myself, ""Is this what you really want to be doing?"", I know the answer is no. But, atleast for some self sustenance, I will have to work for a while - but again, I don't know what I want out of it in my career. Do I want to go into management? Do I want to become a project leader? 

Even in life. Do I want a family? Do I want a house? How much money do I want saved up? Where do I want to go?

So when did everyone get so many friends but me?,"Why does everyone my age have 1000 followers on instagram? Why does everyone have someone to hang out with? How did eveyone make friends and learn proper social skills by my age but I didn't? Why is it that wherever I go, I am the only loner? I never had any wild experiences, cool stories, or lasting friendships. I could never go out to a bar, club, concert, restaurant, sport event, etc. because I would be alone.

Despite me becoming an adult, I never stoped being the ""kid who sat alone at lunch"" like I was as a teen.

Why am I the only one whom no one knows exists? I know its a very bad sign when I realize that realistically, if I turned off my phone and dissapeared, know one would notice besides my parents or my boss.  

I'm too real, take myself to literally. Not chill. I stuggle to find friends and feel like I can't keep them because I do something that eventually makes them leave. Sometimes I fell like I have a too immature mindset, and other times a too mature mindset. I want friends. I'm a friendless introvert who wants to be an extrovert but ends up making a fool of myself.

It is very unhealthy to reach my age without having friends, as you are at an age where you are still young, immature, and learing social skills. It will fuck you up for many years and keep you behind socially in every aspect as you enter adulthood.",bropill,1604725361,No-Situation849,1,1,True,2020-11-06
How do I apologize to someone?,"Hi bros i ik this seems like a dumb question but first I wanna give some context:

recently saw a girl I met on tinder for a casual date (socially distanced with masks ofc) it went really well! There was some dude sitting near us who was making some gross comments (not related to her just in general) and generally interuppting her everytime she spoke, so I offered to take a walk so we wouldn't have to listen to the dude. 
In hindsight she didn't seem to in to talking a walk, we stopped on a corner and kept talking until we both had to go! I feel pretty bad cause when I put myself in her shoes its defintley something that might cause some anxiety, and im worried i made her uncomfortable.

so how do I apologize for this in a way that doesn't make her feel like she did something wrong or where she's more worried about comforting me?

Body Hair on Women,"Hey you guys! 
I’ve been following and reading through this sub for ages- I loooove the good vibes and positive thoughts on here :) 
I have something on my mind for quite some time now but I wouldn’t know who to ask and since everyone here is so friendly and helpful I thought I’d just see if someone has the time to answer and gives me an insight on their perspective. 
I started shaving my legs when I was 12 and ever since there hasn’t been a time where I didn’t shave them. I am almost 22 now. I have not really an excessive amount of hair on my legs but they do grow really fast so I have to shave them every other day, if not everyday to keep them smooth. I love the feeling of smooth legs but I’ve always hated the whole process. I have very dry skin so shaving them AND keeping them hydrated is a really time consuming process.
Now recently I started thinking about just letting it grow because, like I said, I’ve never done that before and don’t know/ don’t remember what it feels like. So I did. And it’s not as awful as I would’ve imagined it to feel. My skin is still smooth but you feel hair. Now during winter time here it’s not like I have my legs on display at all times so I haven’t been worried before but in the back of my head I know body hair on women is a rather controversial topic. I have not been with someone during the time I stopped shaving my legs yet but I really am worried about judgment. 
I know some think it’s unhygienic or simply not aesthetic. 

What are your thoughts on body hair on women? Generally and specifically if you want to be with them romantically or sexually. Do you think it’s reasonable I got tired of the time and cost consuming process?

“We need to normalize XYZ for men” — why don’t you just do it?,"Hey bros, lady bro here. I’m very confused and would like some input.

I’ve been reading a lot more of “men doing/participating in XYZ should be normalized/shouldn’t have a stigma, etc”

What’s stopping you from just doing it? It’s not like men are a marginalized community who need legal protections in place like women, POCs, and LGBTs do. You wanna normalize shit? Stop saying and get out doing.

(Reading that last sentence sounds kinda harsh. It’s meant more in an upbeat jokey, but still a kick in the pants way)

Example: I’m a huge mental health advocate and I think talking about depression, anxiety etc shouldn’t have a stigma. I bring up the fact I take anxiety medication whenever relevant. There. I’m normalizing it.

I’m inclined to think because men, especially white cishet men, have never faced discrimination (for being male) they’ve never learned to band together like women have for example. But it’s kinda infuriating to listen to, these cries of “normalize whatever for men!” because like.. while I 100% support it we live in a patriarchal society whereby male voices have inherent credibility. As a queer woman I’ve had to fight for basic respect in so many areas of my life. I find I don’t have a lot of sympathy when men seemingly want change but lack enough nerve or giving-a-shit factor to change anything. 

(I realize that also sounds harsh - I swear to god I’m not trying to rag on anyone. This is just how I think/communicate, easier to convey over not text)",bropill,1604751102,aSpanks,4,1,True,2020-11-07
Taking too much of the red pill,"
I went through a heartbreak last year and that’s how i found about the red pill. It helped me get motivated to work on myself and it worked but i’m starting to think that it’s not good for me. I binged so many AMS, Stephiscold, and been on the TRP subreddit and it’s just messing with my mind at this point. 

I cant talk to girls without it feeling like it’s logistics or that they’re out to get me. I’m in 8 months drought that i could have broken but i keep overanlyzing every link i have with a girl and it fucks with my confidence. I feel like a narcissist i look at girls like some evil shit and i hate it. It’s good to know female nature but it just feels so negative. 

For example i been chilling with this girl since august. It’s been calm vibes but i never really tried anything. But i do what the red pill people tell me. Don’t text all the time make her chase and i did but now i’m catching feelings and i hate it. They say your not supposed to care and i care it feels like i’m breaking a rule. I wanna fuck her but my self doubt comes in because it feel like i’m taking too long and i’m becoming her “orbiter” or i’m getting friendzoned. I don’t think i am but i don’t even anymore and it’s just fucking with me. I miss it when it was fun to talk to girls now it just gives me anxiety. I wanted to chill w her yesterday but she gotta kid so she couldnt cause she needed someone to watch the kid. The old me would think nothing bout it. Now i’m overthinking it, like damn i lost my chance, imma orbiter, or someone else is fucking and im not and i feel dumb. that’s the other thing cause she had a kid i feel like a dumbass for liking her. I don’t wanna be in the kids life but i fuck with her personality and shit. I hate all this shit cause i feel like that’s not what it is and i’m overthinking it but then i think about all TRP content i seen and read and i start to think damn i’m just beta cuck.

When I am interested to do new projects (mainly physical like woodworking/drawing/building armour, but sometimes digitally) I am very excited to start doing it and I will plan things out.

He told me to say it but that was on my mind anyways. we talked and she said she we can chill and talk bout it. yesterday she hit me up to chill then couldn’t cause she said she couldn’t get anyone to watch her kid. Then i hit her today and she said she was with it but the same thing.

Sum it up i’m starting to go crazy bout this shit. I was told on TRP sub that when you take long to have sex with someone they play games and put you in a friendzone. It making me overthink like damn i lost my chance. I talk to other girls but i just want this one. I keep getting told that’s oneitis but i can’t get over it. Al this red pill shit keeps fucking with me. I probably lost out on a cool girl and it hurts not gonna lie. I feel like a bitch and i hate it. Any advice can help i just hate feeling like this.

Johnny depp bro?,"I’m really at a loss here and I don’t really know where else to discuss this safely. I’m seeing all this love and fanfare for Johnny depp. My reading and understanding of the news was that basically depp psychologically and physically abused his ex wife. Then when she spoke out against him, he sued her for libel (that she made it up). But then recently the judge was like we have all this evidence that you did do all this shit, so it’s not made up, he lost the case and thus he was asked to leave his Harry Potter movie. If I’m reading this correctly, depp is getting the punishment he deserves, at a minimum, where men who violate their power and hurt people should be held accountable and punished.

"Bros, how do you (romantically) get over someone you're close to?","hey bros,

ive been very close friends with this girl for a year and half, two years ish. about a year in to our friendship i realized i had feelings for her.

we talked about it, dating was brought up, she thought about it for a few days, decided she didn't want to do it.

that's fine, we both moved on, everything was good- except i haven't been able to get over her. 

it's been so long- i'd guess at least a quarter, half of a year since this has happened- and i cannot get over my feelings for her. i can't. 

i'm in love with her and i just don't know how to not be. we're extremely close friends, so we've spent hundreds of hours together playing games online, talking casually, having deep conversations, etc.

she's told me about her past, ive comforted her as she's cried, and so on. 

i think one of the worst things i keep on doing is just remembering her telling me, ""whoever is going to date you is going to be so lucky to have someone like you.""

it feels like im doing everything right but also doing everything wrong at the same time with her, bros, and it's awful.",bropill,1604965562,TradeGuineapigPicsPM,9,1,True,2020-11-09
"How exactly can I improve myself for myself, and not for the validation of women when I don’t even know what validation from a woman is like?","Everyone always says you should self improve for yourself and no one else. However, the way i see it is a man who doesn’t know what it’s like to he attractive to women couldn’t possibly just self improve for himself because women’s validation will always be in his subconscious. This is exactly what I’m experiencing now. I’ve lost a ton of weight and graduated college. However, I’m still fat, ugly, don’t make enough money, and i have suicidal thoughts. I understand that i have to work on getting my own place and a good paying job, but throwing out job applications and my resume seem to be going no where as of right now, but I digress. When i was watching RP content a year ago, I thought maybe if i took my weight loss seriously, then maybe some women would find me attractive, but even then, it’s still the same as if I hadn’t lost any weight. 

I did have about 3 relationships with women in the past before my weight loss, but I’ve never had sex with a woman. If i had sex with a woman, then It will be in my mind that i can do it again, and it’ll be easier to let go of this feeling. 

Before you say something like “you shouldn’t place women or sex on a pedestal”, I agree but if a man never experienced sex with a woman, or even worse a relationship, how is he not supposed to put women on a pedestal subconsciously. It inevitable. 

My final question is how am I, a 22 year old man, supposed to work on myself for me when i barely know what’s it’s like to have women’s validation?",bropill,1604974067,ineedavacation4,23,1,True,2020-11-09

I should have talked to her,"I'll try to keep this short and to the point because whenever I post something like this I tend to trail off.

I started university last year in October and on the very first day of uni I saw this really cute girl in a class which I took for my minor. A few days later I saw her in a class for my major, because we share the same major/minor we had a few classes together. but I never had the guts to talk to her. I legit couldn't speak to her, because I got so nervous. In general I feel like my nervousness around other people has increased (I'm seeing the university therapist because of that). I asked a girl out before, that was in school, she said no but at least I asked her out. I've also been on a date with a girl who aske me out, so it's not like I'm totally unfamiliar with dating, although the experience is limited.
It just annoys me that it has been a year since I've gotten to 'know' her (obviously I don't really know her), and I have yet to ask her out. The problem is I wasted my opportunities in the first semester and my country went into lockdown in March due to Covid so I can't walk up to her in class and just strike up a conversation. And texting her so we can get to know each other is weird considering that we don't know each other. 

I just wish I had the balls to get to know her and ask her out during the first semester so that either a) we'd be getting along and talking right now or b) she would have signaled to me that she isn't interested in me and I could have moved on and not waste my time thinking about her right now.",bropill,1602439659,Orioram,1,1,True,2020-10-11
Any other guys feel like crap for being attracted to girls?,"This is a bit of a weird one. Maybe I'm alone on this one, at least I've never heard anyone else talk about it, but if I'm not it'd be nice to know. Also, advice on how to cope with this is greatly appreciated.

So, historically, women have always been shamed for getting horny. Meanwhile, men are expected to want sex all the time. There's this prevalent attitude that our brain shuts off when we see a pair of boobs, and that we we want to sleep with every hot woman we come across. That we objectify them and don't really care about forming meaningful friendships with them, that we're just after their body.

And my God do I despise this stereotype. It can really hurt my ability to become friends with women. They often assume I have ulterior motives when I'm just being friendly. They rarely outright say it (and when they do it *hurts*), but the sentiment is there.

But the thing is... sometimes, they're partially right. It's been 2 years since I've last had sex and I'm getting desperate. Of course it's far from the only thing I think about, but it's there. I meet a hot girl, and I find myself wishing she'd want to sleep with me. Often I get the hots for female friends of mine. And I hate it. Friendships have been ruined because I developed unrequited feelings. So... I counter it as much as I can. I force myself to push any and all sexual feelings aside when I meet new people, and I try to only focus on forming platonic bonds. Friendships are far more important than sex to me. But... it's still something I need in my life. And I feel like absolute shit for thinking that.

Of course, wanting sex doesn't mean I objectify women. I fully respect them as people, and my physical attraction to them doesn't diminish this in any way. But a lot of people don't seem to think that way, or at least they assume that *I* don't think that way. I'm scared of commenting on girls I find attractive (even anime girls, that are often literally designed to be fawned over), I'm scared of showing my attraction in any way because I can already see people stampting me off as just another sex-obsessed man (and for the record, I think this stereotype is absolute bullshit for most men, I don't see myself as an exception). I never flirt, instead I focus fully on forming purely platonic bonds. Which is often good, but not always. I hate the ""men only want sex""-stereotype so badly, I do whatever I can to distance myself from it, and that doesn't seem healthy either.

Luckily, things have been improving. I've found groups of friends, both male and female, who are open about the fact that yes, people do indeed experience sexual attraction and that's okay. I feel comfortable voicing my feelings when I'm with them. But part of me still feels ashamed of it, like it makes me a stereotypical asshole.

Is it just me? Or do other guys feel that way? Feel free to share your experiences if you're not a guy; I know my experience is different from traditional slut-shaming but if you're going through something similar feel free to reply regardless of gender.",bropill,1602443482,Gicaldo,81,1,True,2020-10-11

"Hey bros, I'm proposing soon","Long: tldr at bottom

Preliminary; So, as the title states, I'm proposing soon. I'm a Nb AFAB. He's also a Nb. I feel like this is an okay place to post because he uses he/him. idk.

We've been together for /about/ six years. (We don't have a date because we purposely went by winters because romance or something, but that hasn't proved to be a very viable resource for lineal measurement) We've agreed to marriage but have had mostly ""post-nut clarity"" communications when it comes to legal verbal action regarding our arrangement.

So, like I said we've been together for hot minute. We've seen each other at our worst and our best. We know each other's trauma and light. We've had conversation about further legal engagement and it's led to very positive interaction. I'm like 99.99% sure he'll say yes. But I want to know what could help him feel more special! 

I plan to propose while we're with friends but with friends that have been mutually agreed to be beneficial to our betterment as people. 

I guess I'm just mostly looking for ways to make him feel special. He loves attention, and I want to give him one of the most satisfying evenings I can.

I plan to order him a necklace and ring to replicate our love. (Rosequartz and hematite) the necklace being because we're poly and I don't want him to feel pressured to wear a ring always. 

I love him so dearly and thru all our time together I've learned to love myself and humanity as is. He's been so excruciatingly important to my development as a person. I never want to lose him. While I can't speak for him verbatim, I'd like to think I can extrapolate the same.

What would make a proposal to you feel extra special?
I really just want to insure the evening brings him as close to as much love as I wish for him as possible.

Apologies if this isn't the appropriate sub. I'm just looking to make him feel special! I love him so dearly and he deserves to feel as loved as I feel.

My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday and I need some motivation and inspiration right now.,"I met a girl on tinder a few months ago. We hit it off on the first day we met and got intimate so well. I met her parents, her son, a multitude of her friends and really felt like she was the one.

She was into the poly life and wanted to have many different relationships at a time. This was something I had a problem with as I have tremendous jealousy and insecurity issues. I would always be mad because she would go out and find these guys because of how jealous id get.

There was this one guy we met (J) who i told her I didn't want her seeing. And she was fine with it for a couple weeks since she wanted to help me feel secure with her and what she wants to do. Fast forward to yesterday morning, she informed me that she still wants to pursue something with J and was planning on seeing him the very day that she dropped that bombshell on me. I got upset at this because I felt like she wanted to spend time with him rather than work out the issues that we have between each other. So I kept asking her tons of times not to go see him during that day to the point that she got a bit annoyed about it over me. I then told her that it made me feel like swerving in front of an oncoming semi-truck (which I probably shouldn't have said) and then she believed me to want to commit suicide. But I never directly said that I wanted to commit suicide, just that I felt like doing something like that sometimes.

Later on, she decided to send me a breakup text saying ""Im ending this relationship. I had lots of fun but the last couple of times have been toxic. You'll find someone who will care for you, I know you will. I'm sorry for everything."" 

I then decided to drive all the way to her place on the other end of the city. All the doors were locked so I walked in through the back (which she showed me how to do previously) and went through the back door which was completely unlocked. But as I got in to her place, she told me if I didn't leave she would call the police.

I really don't know what to do here. We were so tight and she often talked about marrying me which makes me so sad right now.

I still only made one friend who I don’t live or work with, I’m in three school clubs, but they only meet once a month and online, and the dorm I live in doesn’t have any real social areas. I used to be okay with this, because I always had a few friends I could reach out to or even hang out with my dad. But now that those aren’t options, I feel stuck and alone. I want to make friends, but it’s halfway through the semester and I feel like everyone has their own social group. I really don’t know what to do anymore.

Given up on life.,"Hey all.  Hope you can tolerate my little rant. I've basically given up on life. I've felt alone for years and dont have anyone I can open up to irl. I dont enjoy the things i used to and just go day to day numb. Used to call myself incel. I'm 18. I wanna die. I'm pretty ugly. Not grotesque but like ugly enough that no one looks at you sexually. I dont have a fun or charming personality to back it up. I just spend my days wasting my time, making music in my basement. Piano,drums, guitar, singing, none spark joy .

How to defeat hate?,"How to defeat hate? A bunch of people hate me for who I am or at least make terrible generalizations, etc. I won’t go deep into it, but there are some toxic people.
 
I logically have a couple optimal options. Just cut them out and allow them to hate, and that’ll probably fit under stoicism, while I follow nihilism and think it’ll be much better getting passive revenge. Whenever I can make their life harder, I will. I don’t see anything inherently wrong with that.
 
For example in the prisoner’s dilemma it’s always better to be selfish. According to simple game theory, you should always give the other person a harder time to put yourself up. I don’t see how this doesn’t apply in the real world.",bropill,1603003733,69_Watermelon_420,0,1,True,2020-10-17

Everytime I'm told that they love me I can't stop myself from thinking that they're just using me, that they're going to leave me like everyone else has.

I’m so tired,"Fair warning this will be somewhat political. But as they say, the personal is political. I just need to write this somewhere.

Y’all. I don’t know how to rest. I just can’t anymore. It’s no longer existential no anticipate devastation. The more I learn and educate myself, the more that makes sense about this world. There have always been answers to the questions we asked as kids, the ones surrounding poverty, homelessness, discrimination, climate change. And the answers are exploitation. It’s all by design. 

Take climate change. I’m a biologist. We know the solutions, sustainable practices, end articula scarcity, invest in renewable energy. We know it can be done, take Costa Rica. We know the obstacles, corporations lying and hiding data, funding politicians, cartels of businesses agreeing to push out innovation. 

The drug war. Admitted by advisors as nothing more than a way to criminalized the poor, poc, and the liberals against the war in Vietnam. Has done nothing but increase incarceration. We know the solutions, decriminalization like Portugal, which has since dropped its overdose, disease transmission, drug violence, incarceration and crime to a fraction of what it was prior.

Human rights. Even if you loathe things like abortion or queer people or the left, were all supposed agree human life is valuable. Banning abortion and cutting sex Ed are proven ways to increase unwanted pregnancy and deaths of the carrier and fetus both. We know gay and trans people pose no danger and that conversion therapy is torture, criminalizing the behavior is barbaric and inefficient. Everyone is supposed to be against fucking fascism and acknowledge black and brown lives matter innately. And yet my country is about to confirm a judge to the highest court in the land who believes in none of those things.

And if all these things were not bad enough, many of those I love can’t bring themselves to act meaningfully. They say to just trust the system, don’t get in trouble, when no movement has ever succeeded in asking nicely, not disturbing the piece, and they won’t stop bringing up MLK like they didn’t kill him too. How can we know the system is broken and then still be expected to function and act within its demands?? Especially when lives are on the line?? Fuck. My life is on the line. The lives of people I love are on the line. People are being evicted during a pandemic and people have the nerve to critique those that lock the courthouse doors? Who graffiti messages of hope like “abolish ICE” when the org is removing people’s organs? Who block fucking traffic when the minimum wage isn’t a living wage?? resistance that polite a goddamn formality at this point. Fuck peace. Fuck asking. I’m damn near close to fuck educating and that’s what I love to do most.

Block or Talk?,"I need some advice on something kind of tricky. 

There's this toxic person I don't really want to be friends with anymore. I've accommodated for them and gone out of my way for them and they've done nothing but treat me badly. They pretty much have the attitude that I'm slow and childish and stupid, and I just want to be done with that. 

I want to just send them a message, block them, and be done, and my gut is strongly telling me to do so. But something is keeping me. 

Should I have a conversation with them?  Should I talk about the issues that happened between us? We never really addressed it. I haven't really talked with them awhile - I don't really want to, I've been trying to get my distance - but they used to be a huge part of my life. And I would be lying if I said a part of me doesn't want to have it out with them. 

But honestly? I'm not sure the conversation would go well or if it would be worth it.  And I'm not even sure they would understand. I have a feeling they would just blame me or deny it. Plus - I don't even really know if I want to continue the friendship or have a discussion with them. 

 Even so, I guess I just wonder. 

And this is a side note I guess, but there have been times where they've been nice to me, and kind to me. And they started getting a lot nicer to me after we graduated high school. But still, the issues just outweighed everything else.

"Practical Guide for Young men: 35 tips to start your Personal Development journey TODAY! (Health, Wealth, and Relationships)","**If you like this post message me to join the private mastermind group also follow me on**[r/Crimsonpill](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crimsonpill/)

Hey guys, here's a list I'm compiled. Bare in mind that this worked for me and it might not apply to your specific situation. Take the list as a rough map to then determine what would work for you. These are mainly my personal experiences that I want to share.

**Personal Development**

**1-Determine what type of guy you are if you are** if you want to travel or if you want to become the master of your city.

2-Let go of grudges towards family or friends is largely counterproductive.

3-**Cut out toxic people** of your life even they are family or friends.

4-Focus on having some stability and then having fun, try to meet a threshold.

5-Focus on wealth, health and then relationships in that order.

**Finances/Financial stability**

6- Focus on finding a low stress job that pays you well enough to take care of yourself.

7-Quit any high stress job that takes away from your life.

8-Settle in one area and sign a long term lease.

9-Make the money work for you and to you working for money.

10-Invest in yourself, if you have to hire mentors the do it. Make sure your mentor is around your same age and has a similar life experience.

**Health**

11-Focus on your health now, to have a foundation for longevity.

12-Don't smoke, don't drink and do drugs. Most people use drinking to overcome anxiety. However, is much better to do anxiety therapy.

13-Adopt a mostly plant based diet, its the best diet for health.Slowly get rid of any other foods.

14-Exercise 3-4 times a week, have a workout tailored to your needs.

15-Pick one sport that you enjoy and practice it recreational on the weekends.

**Fashion**

16-Focus on quality over quantity.

17-Save money to buy a few key pieces.

18-Focus on taking care of your clothes as opposed to buying more.

19-Don't follow threads, they quickly fizzle out.

20-One of the best styles is a classic look, you can find it with Banana Republic and Uniqlo.

**Dating**

21-Don't get married.

22-Don't have kids.

23-Never put all your eggs in one basket,always be spinning plates.

24-Even if you have one girlfriend have a mistress, if your only gf breaks with you it will crush you. But if always have another you will brush it off.

25-Ironically, your chances of staying with your gf and getting her back are higher if you are always spinning plates.

**Online Game**

26-Save money and use it hire a professional photographer, best $150 you'll spend.

27-Make sure you have one clear headshot, one full body shoot and few of you doing activities.

28-Some good sports to do are surfing, tennis and snowboarding.

29-Pictures with dogs work, borrow a dog from a friend.

30-Keep the texting short and sweet, focus on the goal of meeting up.

**Game and Wingmen**

31-Don't go to local pick up groups, unfortunately, most of the guys tend to be socially awkward.

32-The best wingmen are naturals.

33-The best place to find naturals is at hostels.

34-One of the best ways to learn pick up is to stay at a Youth hostel.

35-The best way I found to learn Game is to go to Las Vegas, stay at Hostel cat and frequent talk of the town(stripclub).

How do I get over the fear of making a second step?,"What happens quite often to me is that I meet a girl (and sometimes boys) on are party or something like that, and I have great interactions with that person, we flirt a bit and then I just don't ask for her/his number. And I don't know why I can't just do that. It wouldn't even be too bad if that person wounded want to give me there number, I can Handel that. The fear prevents me of doing that step. It feels like standing on one of those big towers they have at swimming pools and beeing to afraid to jump. I know that if I do jump nothing to bad will happen but I just can't do it. 
And it is the same situation if I get someones number because they make the first step. Frear prevents me from making the next step. And it has been like that for quite some while and it's not really getting better and I don't know what to do.",bropill,1603233387,91anders,2,1,True,2020-10-20

Nightclub etiquette and social interaction,"Hello fellow Kings,

I come to you in a time of need. As restrictions ease up and life begins to return to normal the night life where I live has begun to restart. I need advice on approaching women in nightclubs. I'm decent looking, I work out, have a good job, and am in all other contexts charismatic and easygoing. I pride myself on being ethical in my hookups; clear intentions, no coercion, no manipulation, and explicit consent. I used to experience severe social anxiety and was extremely awkward but learned most of my social skills as an adult via observation and despite having spent two years as a bouncer I still don't know what to do as a patron. I like music and dancing, but always feel really awkward and out of place, even with a drink or two. I'm very verbal in my interactions with people, and it seems to me that most sexual communication in nightclubs is unspoken. I'm not normally risk adverse when it comes to trying new things, but since the risk I'm taking is coming off as a creep I'd like to have more insight on what exactly is appropriate or what the unwritten rules are for this. Any insight or thoughts by Bros or Fembros especially is appreciated. Hopefully this is a good place to post this, I fucking hate pickup forums.",bropill,1603252977,Oorahboi,2,1,True,2020-10-20

Don't know what I'm looking for in a relationship,"I \[23M\] was asked out by someone \[25F\] who I have seen at the climbing wall a few times. I have never been asked out before, which was very weird and nice as a guy. This happened, weirdly enough, the moment I accepted that it'd be cool to be friends with this person with no expectations (which is rare/hard for me to do with women). Relationships/intimacy are things I have been really craving for a long time and I've been working on myself a lot in that respect. It's strange because I was not immediately super all-in attracted to her (which I think is usually a signal I am looking for - whether that is good idk), I am curious and flattered and there is a little attraction too, but mainly we just get along really well in terms of humour and similar interests. Though also both mega awkward haha. We went on a date and it was cute, and we kissed and held hands and stuff, but I have absolutely no idea what I actually want. I know that I liked the physical intimacy, and I enjoy her as a person a lot, but I feel bad for not knowing if I want something serious with her. And if I don't right now, maybe I will later? I don't want to string her along or send her mixed messages. I feel like I'm not supposed to want something more casual or even sexual - or it's somehow disappointing. At the same time, I feel like if I communicate any of this to her, she wont want anything with me, or it'll sour somehow. Part of me is saying I could do 'better' (whatever that even means. I feel bad for judging) - I like queerer/hippier looking/acting people, but perhaps that's superficial or an unnecessary ideal that is stopping me from making genuine connections with people. I'm also at a point in my life where everything's kind of up in the air with regards to jobs and living. Plus I'm just now coming to feel more attractive and confident in myself and want to open myself up to different relationship dynamics than the ones ingrained in my head and like the prospect of having more experiences with other people. I have barely dated, so I really don't know myself in this area. I also have anxious attachment style, so even though she was the one who asked me out, I was immediately like ""crap, what do I have to do/be to get her to keep liking me? What is the correct amount of time to wait between texts/what do I say/am I too much/etc?"". So this effects it, but is also an opportunity to outgrow that pattern.

It's a mess lol. Not that deep tho. Definitely a lot of gender roles about men effect my thinking here. How we are disgusting, predatory, hypersexual, heartless, etc.

Basically I (18M) am really struggling with everything at the minute, my mental health is all over the place and I’ve got no fucking clue where to start to try sort it out, been going on since end of last year probably. My self confidence is pretty much non existent to the point I’m starting to really dislike myself as a person (wish I was better looking, never had a gf, too shy, social anxiety getting worse) and lately I’ve been having suicidal thoughts which I don’t think I’m going to act on but it’s pretty scary when I look back and see where I was a year ago, I don’t want to say it’s depression though as I’m not diagnosed and don’t want to take attention away from people who really need it.

I’ve tried opening up to a couple friends I’m closest to but that’s done nothing to help, one of them has started ignoring me and I barely talk to anyone at all now, I’m shit scared of trying to get help cos it sounds like my idea of hell (hate talking about myself and being centre of attention) and im so tired of feeling like this.

Fragile ego,"Good day bros, I have a problem.

I always think of myself as a pretty self-confident person - and most times I am. But sometimes people just say stuff to me that totally throw me off of my positivity.

Like today I was jamming with my band when a strange (probably drugged, she looked suspicious) woman came to watch us in our room. After some songs she remarked that I acted like a little boy that was afraid of her. This totally caught me off guard, cause I felt really really confident and rational.

Even though my bandmates reassured me that they also thought that she was high as hell, I can't shake the feeling off that they think of me as less a man.

I know that those feelings are stupid and that I reacted the right way in just shrugging off her opinion, saying that I can't trust people like her.

Hey bros... (A rant),"This might be a bit messy, since I am on mobile, and not the best at expressing things, so I'll try my best. I am a 15M, who had great expectations for this year. I had developed my socials skills to a decent point, and was actually happy with who I was, until 2020 happened.

Since then, I had barely any contact with my buddies, because I am especially bad at maintaining contact, and a conversation. All my human interaction was locked behind a screen, and that's where it began. I slowly started to lose everything I had developed, suddently, I couldn't even wave to a person irl, and my voice was barely audible, I was back on square one, with my shyness and anxiety reaching an all time high.

But it got worse, when I started losing my motivation. My school is dumping us with homework without a care in the world, and since I can just look up the answers, or to straight up not turn them in, why care so much? I was a massive workacholic in presencial school, turning in all papers without fault, and now I can barely pull myself to do one. All my work ethic, and efforts? To the gutter
 
I feel like this year took everything I built in these 15 years, and threw it in the trash. I am no longer the hard working, high effort guy I was in 2019, I am an antissocial mess, who barely scrapes by a day, and can't even express how he truly feels.

Idk if this is a thing of the age, or if I am ""just being a teenager"", but it is being frustrating, and tiring to look at that screen, waiting for the next week to come by, like an endless, meaningless cicle, until this dumpesterfire of a year to end, so I can finally rest, and try to get my head at ease

I have no idea how, but I will manage to pull throught this shit, just so I can smear it in life's face and tell them I won, I am just resentful for what will happen until I get this ""victory""

I guess I needed this venting, especially considering I am not taken seriously for my age, and that I can't express how I fucking feel, so that was that.

Obviously, I want her to be happy, I just wish I was the person she was happy with. Our relationship got muddled up last year as we were kinda solicited into doing sexual things we wanted to come naturally. But we were both naive and didn’t realize it was not a good thing at all. It started weighing on my and especially her conscious, which caused her to start acting cold and distant to me. We split in March and remained best friends while also kinda talking, I really thought we could repair it and start again. Now it’s over and I’m heartbroken. What should I do bros? It’s all pain, all I have is the weightroom and my two bestfriends but everything else feels hollow and empty. I really really liked this girl, she was funny and sweet with a bit of a flame and I can’t help but feel responsible for realizing all the things that hurt our relationship too late.",bropill,1603498159,Bananasinmypocket,0,1,True,2020-10-23
How do I stop becoming bitter?,"I've been noticing lately that I start to feel a bit biiter or jealous whenever one of my friends starts talking about the new guy/girl they're dating, how they got laid last night or how easy it is to get laid. As a 23 year old kissless virgin, this sometimes gets to me. They think that I'm not a virgin, and honestly I wouldn't ever tell them or anyone that I know irl that I am one. They're good people, and I do want to feel happy for them, but now I'm just starting to feel jealous and I dont like it. I'm not just sitting around feeling sorry for myself, I'm trying to improve myself and I've tried dating apps in the past.

Got passed over for a promotion. Feels bad bro.,"I've been working for a major tech corporation for 3 years now.  For a while now I've been doing pretty good work.  It's not exactly the work I dreamed of doing, but I'm good at it and I try to leave it all on the field.  My performance reviews are consistently positive, but I can't get any more raises until I get promoted.  However our promotion process is famously disconnected from reality.  They've very cleverly arranged things so that my manager is always on my side, but some faceless committee gives me a shitty excuse for why my work still isn't good enough.

I just got passed over for promotion again and... I'm not sure I've got another performance cycle in me.  Especially with Covid, I just feel so burnt out and disconnected.  I don't see any reason to do my best any more.  

The worst part is that when I think about moving to another company, I don't know why they would want me.  I'd just be a burnt out dude doing a burnt out job.  This is supposed to be one of the best companies in the world to work for, and if I feel like shit here why would I feel better somewhere else?

I hate how much of my life and value as a man has been defined by success in my profession.  I hate how much of my life I have traded away and compromised for employers who gaslight me and squeeze me for all I'm worth.  This is supposed to be one of the best jobs in the world, and it's still wringing me dry.

I think capitalism is a crock of shit.  Even at the top of the trash heap it's still a trash heap.

Feeling conflicted about best friend's refusal to hug me,"My only current guy best friend is such a great person! I can talk to him about all my feelings and the idle thoughts that just go through my mind, and he shares openly with me too. He was the first person I came out to about my sexual orientation and painful feelings about gender.

I'm very verbally affectionate. Why not let this great person know how much I love him and all of his great qualities, ya know? Yet, even with all this, we've never really been physically affectionate. That's fine (some people just aren't all about that), but recently I told my friend about some deep troubles of mine

He also makes me feel better, so it went well, but I mentioned that I'd really like a hug. He seemed conflicted and told me he doesn't like giving hugs. I asked him why and he just shrugged.

I respect his decision, but I can't help but feel a little isolated from him or a bit confused/betrayed because I love physical affection a lot. I know he didn't mean any harm, and I feel selfish for feeling this way, but does any one know how to feel close to another person when your expressions of affection don't line up?",bropill,1603588374,Jojoref,1,1,True,2020-10-24

I’ve bought clothes, I lost 80 pounds, I got a car, even right now I’m eating like 800 calories a day to try to keep losing weight, but none of that offset my appearance.

Overcoming fear of judgment in dating,"Hey bros, I'm a 22-year-old guy who just graduated college and moved to a new city/university for work. Due to bullying/harassment until my late teens, and a very conservative upbringing by Indian immigrant parents who stressed studying to the exclusion of all else, I'm fairly new to the dating scene.

One thing that. really bothers me isn't rejection as such, but the possibility that my romantic interest (or even a woman's *perception* of it, real or imagined) would itself attract negative judgment, fear, hatred, or ridicule. It's already happened a few times in undergrad; once from a TA who unilaterally spread rumors that I was ""intimidating"" (even as she extensively discussed her online-dating life with students, an explicit violation of the sexual-harassment policy), other times over similar non-issues. In no case had I done so much as even ask these women to coffee.

From conversation with (female) mentors and friends, I came to learn of a pervasive stereotype that Indian men are sexist, persistent/desperate, and dangerous, and that hence I'd be regarded with some suspicion. Most women of course weren't like this, but where I did undergrad, I ran into enough such cases that I was always on guard, and threw away *many* perfectly good opportunities. Where I am now, this fortunately doesn't seem to be as common. How can I overcome my fear of judgment, and become a better judge of character to filter out those who would judge me harshly?",bropill,1603662026,globeglobeglobe,7,1,True,2020-10-25
Apparentely I'm a misogynist,"Heya,

So to explain the situation, I've been talking with my female friend about how I felt inferior to women and that I refused to complain because they have it harder than us and as such is willing to give anything since they ""deserve"" it more than me.

How do I let go?/Vent,"Hey all, it's been about 3 months since I broke up with my ex, and slowly, I feel at least, things have been getting better. The first month I was bearly willing to get out of my bed but now I'm basically back to my about normal self. 

However, she randomly pops into my head randomly throughout the day, and any activities that involved her I get thoughts of her as well. These thoughts are most abundant when I try to sleep. This isn't negativity affecting me in a way, I just enjoy it without getting into details and brush it away. But what is affecting me is when I see her name, it feels like a sucker punch into my guts and feels like my heart skipped a beat. I've been no contact with her and I guess my group of friends, ~ 1 month, we have a lot of mutual friends. I don't feel particularly lonely or depressed since I've started, in fact, I feel happier and more content with myself. Thought a big reason why I'm also no contacting my friend group is because I feel ashame and a coward... 

I've given up hope on getting back together and forgive her, but deep down inside I feel like I haven't... Maybe it's because it's too early and only time will help with the healing but in the meantime, does anyone have tips for letting go on a deeper level? I kind of want the pain to stop and bring myself to be able to face her and friend group. 

This is my first relationship if that helps, haha.

I just had a huge dosage increase (10mg to 40mg) on my antidepressant which has put me in the weirdest mood and honestly a pretty bad mindset. This is a lot of oversimplification, but basically: I got super upset because he was assuming things about my family, specifically how I felt about them and how they would make me feel if I went on a day trip with them tomorrow. He said some less-than-nice things about my father, and I've explicitly asked him before not to say the types of things he said. I was a bit manic at the time and in response I said things I shouldn't have, but also some things I genuinely felt and meant but probably shouldn't have brought up at the time. I also tend to be very blunt. He felt insulted, attacked, and hurt by this and it kicked his anxiety into overdrive. Now, we have very different conflict resolution styles. I want to talk it out until we both understand and there isn't a problem anymore. He just shuts down. And I can't stand it when he does. I don't know how to handle it, and it really hurts me a lot when he doesn't talk the problem out with me. He says to leave him alone, so of course I, in my fluoxetine-induced manic depressive state, send him message after message apologizing, but he doesn't want to hear it and only tells me to please stop talking to him.

Please Help! (19M),"Right now my life is in a bit of a state.

First of all I am having a lot of trouble with anxiety, I struggle to talk confidently or eloquently in pretty much all social situations. My voice falters, I stammer and I get extremely flustered during conversation. I also experience spiralling regret throughout the day, cringing or panicking about past mistakes: where I have said or done something stupid, unkind or offensive, or generally done something embarrassing. I feel unable to get over these images, also feeling regular suicidal or self-destructive impulses.

Over the past year, but especially over lockdown I seem to keep losing friends, both friends from school or new friends from university. At least two people have stopped reading or replying to my messages after I have reached out, and I have not made contact with many others. I have always struggled to fit in, and I feel like people grow to dislike me over time, and that I may be fundamentally unlikeable. This has been a major source of hopelessness looking towards the future.

Over lockdown I have also put on a lot of weight, mostly the result of over eating, lack of exercise and drinking way too much alcohol. I currently have a very negative view of my body, adding to the feeling that I have no romantic prospects in the future. I am extremely concerned that I give off a ‘creepy’ vibe towards women, and am paranoid about having acted inappropriate towards women in the past.

On the positive side, I have a very supportive family, and I have hobbies that I enjoy, especially caring for plants. I hope to start an online plant nursery next year, so I will be able to make a living doing something I love. I am also totally committed to improving myself and the world around me.

But he never let that slow him down or make him bitter. Over our five years in college, we would get to know each other better and live with each other for three years. We had conversations, drank, watched tv and movies, all the usual stuff. But more than that. One morning, we came across someone laying on a hill with a face half-bloodied. He had been out there all night. Turns out he got the crap beaten out of him the night before. It had something to do originally with him being called the n word.

Due to the pandemic, I've been working remotely since March, and in May my mental health was super bad and I was in a really dark spot. So, I decided to go home and stay with my mom for a few weeks so I could separate myself as much as I could from my current situation and just spend time with family. That was awesome and I thought it would be cool to do it again in the fall, so I've been home for a few weeks again, for the second time. 

My mom and I used to have a pretty bad relationship. We spent a lot of my mid to late teens, and early twenties arguing pretty viciously about grades and the future and the like. Fast forward to now, I think we have a halfway decent relationship and can at least understand where each other are coming from. But I feel like as I've spent the last seven years working on my own mental health and healing, I've begun to see how bad (potentially) my mom's is. Let me be clear: I am not trying to diagnose her or push her into anything, but I have my concerns. The most notable and troubling example is when I was home the last time, she made an offhanded comment that she wanted to die after explaining to me how suicidal she was when her parents died while she was in her twenties. I literally didn't know what to say so I just changed the subject really quickly, but she's made similar comments about wanting thing like that in the past. 

She also got broken up with about two years ago (rather brutally I might add) by this guy she dated. She really, genuinely, loved him and this was the first relationship I'd seen her happy in since her and my dad split up about 15 years ago. I didn't really like him all that much, and the relationship 100% had its faults (at least as far as I could tell), but she liked him and that's all that mattered to me. But, I feel like since that ended she hasn't really recovered. She also hates her job and her coworkers, and recently moved into a new house, but she's not super happy here and is looking to move again in a few years. She's in the process of doing some reno's and updates, but for the past two months the house has sort of been in this weird limbo, ""some parts are done some parts are not"" state. It kinda feels like no one really lives here. I also feel like she just doesn't take part in the things every human has to do: cooking and cleaning. I'm not saying she has to do those things because she's a woman/mother, but instead because *we all* have to in order to just have a decent quality of life. There's a bunch of expired food in the fridge and when I asked to clean it out/organize it I could tell there was a little friction there. For example I threw out a container of blueberries that were basically raisins (they've been in the fridge since July) and she got upset at that. We have either have no cleaning supplies or we have three of the same item from them just being rebought. I also went to vacuum the house today, and the vacuum is broken. I know if I suggest her buying a new one she'll be resistant to that. 

All this to say, I'm worried about where she is and how it will affect our family moving forward. She seems to be anti-therapy because of some past experiences with therapists, and especially now because of covid, she has explicitly said that she ""can't do the phone therapy"". (Also, while I was on antidepressants she called me a drug addict, and when I told her that I was taking them because I was suicidal, she just shrugged her shoulders.) I'm happy to help her as much as I can to get through these things, but I also have my own issues to worry about and I'm not a mental health professional. I just don't know how to have a conversation with her about this without her being offended or her lashing out because I feel like that's 100% how she would react. But, I can recognize the signs of something underneath the surface being wrong from my own experiences, and I don't feel right now bringing it up. 

I know that reddit isn't the best source for this, but I really needed to get this off my chest because it's been kinda coming to a head lately. I also hope I didn't paint myself to be some self-aggrandizing asshole who is taking this opportunity to put his mom on blast, I'm genuinely concerned. I promise.

Why do people feel entitled to criticize others hobbies for not being interesting?,"Sorry in advance for the rant

I'm  feminist and I beleive that men who belittle and put down women's hobbies and interests for being ""feminine"" are gross and mysognist and that people dont live to cater to others needs. But lately I've been seeing a lot of other feminists who I usually agree with on most things putting down hobbies like fishing or other traditionally masculine hobbies and I feel very conflicted.

I beleive that gender roles should be done away with all together and I know that toxic masculinity isnt just liking masculine things but I feel like theres a  double standard which kind of weakens the whole message of a lot of feminist thought. What caused me to make this point was this account on instagram which posted something pretty innocuous on a feminist Instagram. Of course some guy in the comments flipped out for no reason but instead of just removing their comment the account instead said something like ""no girls want to get with you because of that fish picture"" and like I feel that's a very un progressive take. And this isnt the only place I see this where it's like ""do men think posting fish on their Instagram is going to attract women"" or something else along those lines. 

I don't have issues with women saying all men are trash because I understand the trauma that many women have faced and this isnt about that, I just feel like people need to stop acting like other people exist for your own benefit. Also people dont do hobbies to attract other people and if that comment was made towards an ace person think of how rude that would be. I wouldn't post a fish picture because I kinda hate fish but this hypocrisy bothers me. I'm not a very masculine guy but I feel like my few activities I enjoy which are traditionally associated with guys are usually mocked and belittled and I don't want to say anything so I'm not the ""not all men"" guy. I'm probably overreacting but I needed to get this off my chest.",bropill,1601476262,tortelliniFranke,23,1,True,2020-09-30
"I have fallen into a rut and I feel like I am becoming a passive and unmotivated person, letting life pass me by. How do you go about changing your life and becoming excited/motivated again?","My (21m) life in the past few months has become work-&gt;gym-&gt;browse reddit/insta/youtube-&gt; sleep-&gt;repeat, and I feel unhappy how uneventful and wasteful my life feels.  Every day is the same day, I see the same few people, and nothing interesting or exciting happens.  Because of this, I have become a very unmotivated and passive person, letting my youth slip by.

I think the biggest source of my unhappiness is the fact that I'm simply not socialzing with ANYONE.  

I should have realized that staying home from college this fall would result in me having no friends for awhile since I have none in my hometown.  But with covid still going on I haven't had the chance to make new friends, nor do I know how to.

I have read enough posts online that say try to find meetups in your area, sports leauges, clubs your interested in, etc.  I'm just not sure how to take the first step in finding those things.

I work in the travel industry, we had mass layoffs months ago. Kudos to the company they weren’t sneaky about it - always communicating “listen it’s going to happen, we’re not sure when or who but be prepared”. This time, today.. we didn’t see this coming.

I lost 3 team members who I’ve been worked w for almost 4 years. They’re some of the best people I’ve ever known. But my old boss (stepped down a few years back to focus on herself)... I’m on the fucking high end of the pH scale bc I’m so basic I can’t even.

She hired me, created a whole new spot on her team for me bc when I interviewed there wasn’t one available. She trained the absolute everloving fuck out of me and gave me one of the best role models I’ve ever known. I wouldn’t be half the professional I am without that woman.

And now she’s just gone. I hate this. I hate that my current boss was put in the position of letting her go. I don’t imagine current boss is doing ok either.

My best friend has told me that I shouldn’t immediately tell him that I’m attracted to him in case I scare him away.

Second time was a month ago at someone's 21st. She was having an emotional evening and I saw she wanted to cry in the middle of the dance floor so I went over and hugged her and she cried in my chest but never talked about it.

Third time was a few weeks ago, just saw her across the room and she smiled and waved at me. I was having a rough night so I didn't speak to her. 

I promised myself the next time I saw her I'd speak to her. But it's been a while and I feel like I should just message her. I just have no idea how to do it without coming off as weird.

"How can i deal with loneliness, envy and inner unrest ?","Hi bro's since a long time i got those emotional problems and those episodes of sadness and hopelesness that overcome me out of nowhere and i tried to investigate those feelings to understand why i got them.
After a longer thought process i realized that one of the root aspects of my problem is loneliness and the deep envy and even hatred i got for people that aren't alone.
I know that hating on others for being happy or having friendships and relationships is wrong but i can't controll this emotional response.
I never showed it externally and i never showed any kind of aggression against the people i envy.
It's more of a inner thing that plays out in my mind.
It eats me away and i think if i don't keep this feeling in check i will end up as a misreable person or worse i will become a cynic that values nothing in life.

I don't know why but most of the time when i got those episodes i question the people arround me and i question myself.
When i see people having something like a best friend or a great relationship with someone else 
i ask myself ""why it's them and not me"".
""Why did they desrve that and why i didn't?""
""What did i do wrong ?""
""Will i be forever alone?""
I know that i sound entitled and petty but i can't controll those thoughts.
In my life i never could connect to someone else deeply enough to talk about my feelings, fears or desires openly.
Dont be mistaken i got friends and a social circle but i somehow feel forgotten by them and always when we connect it's me who starts conversations.
I always have the feeling that i am left out that i am the second or third choice and that no one give a fuck about me.
I tried to be as open as possible i hope you guys can give me any tips or advice on combating those thoughts.

School is a hopeless endeavor. I dont have grades for university and I dont have the give a shit or marks for it anyway. Uni seems like a expensive trap so it was never in my plans but I dont even have to motivation to do the assignments I get let alone have the motivation to do anything in life. 


I feel hollow and I can tell im not happy but I dont even care anymore I think about getting mortally wounded so maybe I feel excited in life that something interesting happened to me for example getting hit by a truck going 45 kmh seems fun to experience. Now that I think about it I dont think ive been happy in 3 years and if I have it only lasted about a week.


I know I should seek help but at this point I dont even think it can help at least not more than the weed i smoke helps. Ive had 3 major addictions in life and I don't even care if I get coronavirus.

My Repressed Sexual Assault Story (tw),"***Please read all the way through.***

When I was in elementary school, I used to be babysat by my aunt. She was an irresponsible babysitter, taking us to our uncle’s house where she’d drink and smoke with other friends, and leaving us to wander aimlessly in the backyard around all that rowdiness.

My mom often felt that I was incompotent and couldn't do anything by myself, so even though I could shower and bathe perfectly well by myself in fourth grade, my mom still soaped me up in the shower and my aunt did the same thing at night when my mom worked late.

My memory gets hazy here, but I remember feeling increasingly uncomfortable with my aunt cleaning me up in the shower and one day she started commenting on my body telling me how I was going to grow up, and I can’t remember if she stroked my penis or squeezed my butt or whatever, but I felt so violated that day. I don’t know if I told my mom or not, or if I even thought she’d care if I told her what happened, but all I knew was that I felt really bad at that young age, and most of my memories of the moment are probably fuzzy because my mind tried to suppress that trauma.

Later, I was going through puberty at a young age for boys (at 10 years old in fifth grade) and while my mom bathing me didn’t bother me, I was really uncomfortable knowing that my babysitter would eventually see me like this. I told my aunt when she came to babysit that I didn’t want her to shower me, that I could do it myself, but when I got into the shower, she followed. I felt so uncomfortable with her presence and her soaping up my body. I told her “I don’t want to hear that” when she talked about hair in my pubic area because I just felt a pit in my stomach and was so terrified. She of course acted like my discomfort was teenage angst or embarrassment, but she walked out and I rinsed myself off alone. I was thinking in the shower that day about why I felt so different when my aunt showered me, and I remembered that a year before, she touched me inappropriately as I described above and I viscerally hated her and felt so sad that I felt so mad and felt I could do nothing about it. I didn’t want to keep that terrifying memory though, so I guess I repressed it and these memories only started coming back when I was in high school.

When I was younger, I was always told that a girl hitting a boy or a girl raping a boy was always less impactful, didn’t matter as much, or at least was so rare that it didn’t seem to matter to anyone. (The adults didn’t tell me the stuff about rape, but my elementary school had a lot of troubled kids who talked about stuff that they shouldn’t know, so the idea that sexual harassment by a woman didn’t matter was already in my head.) When my mom first got my aunt as a babysitter I expressed concerns about her bathing me, but it didn’t matter I guess because she was a woman touching my boyish body, not a man touching a girl like most sexual assault scenarios would play out in a person’s head.

Regardless of what I had to endure at a young age, I just need to tell someone now that what I experienced was real. Because my middle-school depression covered up a lot of my memories from my childhood, it’s hard to pick out some details, but I really feel that this happened and this is what I can try to force myself to remember from that experience.

Please don’t think I’m lying or making this up in my head. I already feel like I might just be crazy and remembering my past just as I want it to be (which, yeah, it doesn’t make sense that I’d ***want*** rape as a part of my life story, but I guess this is the type of doubt victims go through). I’m so sorry for giving you an essay; I just wanted to tell someone this. I don’t know if anyone really cares about what happened nearly a decade ago, but I’m reliving this experience in my head, and I’m just feeling a lot of negative emotions about why I had to go through so much bullshit.

These memories came back yesterday night when I was reading that about 40% of trans/non-binary people are sexual harassed in college and this was people who attended a ***liberal*** University in the ***liberal*** state of Massachusetts. I ***really*** don’t want to be victimized again, but I feel I have to choose between personal safety and personal identity. I’m going to choose personal identity ultimately, but with a lot of caution with how people treat me.

***Anyway, thanks for reading all the way through. I hope others in the*** r/bropill ***community can feel a bit less alone with their repressed physical, sexual or emotional harassment.***

TL;DR: I was sexually assault by my aunt as a child. I only recently relived those experiences as it was such a repressed memory, but now I want others to know that it's okay to have fuzzy memories of something happening to you. It still affected you, which makes it real.",bropill,1602094717,Jojoref,7,1,True,2020-10-07
Is it Weird That I Never Had Any Romantic Experiences at 18?,"Hey there bros!  


I've been 18 for about 3 months now and honestly i find it strange that i have never had a romantic experience yet. i never held hands with someone i like, i never kissed, im still a virgin, and ive not even had a crush before! the fact that i havent been able to get a date or get laid has been bothering me greatly, especially since many of my peers throught highschool seem to be getting those things and i seem to be missing out. Is it weird though?  


Secondly, what may be the reasons why i cant get any dates? what can i do to improve myself in order to attract partners and have relationships? Got any advice on how to lose my virginity/get laid so i wont feel so pressured about not being able to attract anyone? i certainly dont want to become an incel or anything like that.

Girl queries.,"Was talking to a girl on tinder since April during the beginning of lockdown. Got close and she agreed to go out with me a few times. Spoke for a few months but she slowly started ghosting me or not really giving much of a reply anymore. I assumed she wasn’t interested in me or she was using me as a joke for the whole time. Now she’s regularly been hitting me up every week or so asking how I am and making small talk. It’s really awkward because any closeness we had is really awkward and tainted now because it feels like there’s an atmosphere and I kind of accepted it wasn’t going to go anywhere, which still hurts but you can’t force someone to like you. She said she wasn’t fucking me around and things just got confused. Idk if she actually liked me and she’s too nervous to actually SAY something instead of making polite conversation or if she’s just bored or looking for attention or money. It hurts to think about because I really liked her and it’s the closest I’ve been with someone for a while and I still regularly feel really unhappy without talking to her, but it feels so awkward now and tainted like an elephant in the room.

Why can't I be a man?,"Hey y'all, it is I, a guy.

One of the issues I've recently been struggling with is masculinity and it's really troubling. For the longest time, I didn't give a shit about being manly, but now that I've started getting in touch with my African roots, I suddenly care about being manly? Like masculine force of nature kind of manly. And it frustrates me that I'm weak as fuck. I don't lift. I don't finish projects. I have abandonment issues. I lack confidence. It makes me upset that I have these standards about what it means to be a man that I can't meet myself.

And what's worse, it's making me a worse feminist. I used to have no issues with women talking about women's issues, but now whenever feminists call out toxic man behavior, I get angry? Idk why, but it just bothers me a lot now. Is it because I am defining masculinity in terms of misogyny or something else? I'm not sure.

All in all, I wanna be more manly. I want to have confidence and trust in myself. I want to have guy friends and do guy friend things like play video games or do stupid shit for no reason or take off my short around the homies and no one say a word. It's my dream to just be a regular guy, or at least a regular masculine guy, and I don't know how to get there in a healthy and pro feminist way.

Basically I think I drink too much and I may be starting to have some alcoholic tendencies.

How do I escape loneliness?,"Back in January I broke up with my ex girlfriend and ever since then things have been slowly going downhill.

First, I was having difficulty letting her go, even though I was the one that broke up with her, because I was afraid of being alone. Me and my ex had a very toxic relationship that ended when she forced me to have sex with her. I almost got back together with her, which was stupid of me to want.

For about 7 months, I was haunted by nightmares of her forcing me to have sex with her, her touching me and other things, such as screaming matches. At this point I was either not able to sleep because of the loneliness or having nightmares and I could never get any rest. I apologized to her (I don't remember what I apologized for, looking back, I shouldn't have done that).

About a month later I did the dumbest thing I could do and asked her if she was willing to hook up just so I could feel something, even if it's fake.

Now, the nightmares have stopped but every night I can hardly sleep because of the loneliness. I just suffer alone in bed and wait until I fall asleep.

"I'll be separating from my girlfriend in week because I'm permanently leaving the country, and it hurts. Let's chat!","Full disclosure, this was also posted to r/CasualConversation.

I have been dating my current girlfriend for almost a year. We met in our university performing arts club, where she worked as a sub-committee member in my department. The way we got together was convoluted; I was involved with someone else at the time, and she was hopelessly crushing on another dude in the department. But eventually, through a series of events, the obstacles cleared up, and on the night of our showcase event, we admitted our feelings towards each other. Ever since then, things were mostly smooth sailing.

Here is where things muddle up. I am an international student, and we both were acutely aware that once I was done, I had to leave the country. Due to COVID-19, I’ve been able to stay back a lot longer than initially expected, but now, my flight back is scheduled in less than a week. On Monday, we’re going on our final date where we will eventually separate. And it hurts.

I know the usual questions. Why did I get into this knowing it will end? What else did I expect if not this? Why not try long-distance? For the last question, I can assure you, as I have rationalised it to myself a million times by now, that LDR won’t work for us, firstly because I do terribly at it, and secondly, because I will never be returning to this country, at least in the next ten years. I’ll be flying back home for six months, and after that, I will be pursuing my master’s program elsewhere. Will she be able to join me? Highly unlikely, since her family constraints means that she will be staying back here, probably for the rest of her life.

As for the first two questions, the only answer I can provide is, I don’t know. I don’t know why we both decided to dive headlong into a relationship when we knew that the only thing at the end of a wonderful road is disaster. We were both working through a lot of stuff when we first met, and I know what you’re thinking: we just jumped into this because misery loves company, right? But no, our relationship has been going extremely well, and we do genuinely like each other beyond our mutual suffering. I guess we both saw a chance at happiness in each other and decided to grab it with both hands while we still could. We knew there was no future, but at that point, it mattered less compared to how we made each other feel. How we still make each other feel.

That's what I always said to her when she asked me why I wanted to date her. She makes me happy. I don't regret the relationship one bit, and if given a chance to turn back time, I'd do it all over again. Does this make me stupid? Maybe. I was never the best at learning from negative stimuli. But I know that this is an indelible, irreplaceable part of my life. I'm a better man for it.

I suppose you’d be right to point out that I brought this upon myself. I’m very aware of that, thanks. I’m not looking for advice. I know what’s coming, and I know it will hurt. From what we’ve talked about so far, we know we still want to be in each other’s lives as friends, and given the nature of this breakup, there will be no animosity. But it sucks, you know? Having something so great, but it has an expiry date stamped on its forehead.

We made each other extremely happy. But our happiness was borrowed. And now it’s time to return the happiness and replace it with the grief of losing a bit of yourself in another person. It is excruciating.

If you’ve read this far, thank you! Opinions, questions, emotions, reprimands – fire away. Let’s talk about it.",bropill,1599936387,nshud2,15,47,True,2020-09-12

I’ve been feeling awful these pass two weeks,"So for about two weeks I have been truly alone. No one to call family, no friends left to care. I made a horrible mistake and unintentionally hurt my friends. I wish they had told me sooner how I made them feel, I would’ve change, but a last they all hate me and now I am blocked or ghosted by them all. My own family hasn’t been too involved in my life either, growing up I never really knew my own mother. 

Now I am left alone, in a household that only serves as a resting place close to work. My Mother spends most of her days with her Boyfriend at his house and my Brother has friends who actually like him, which is more then I can say.

This loneliness is painful, but nothing compare to the guilt I feel. Worst thing is, this wasn’t the first time I lost all my friends. Twice it has happen to me. At this point I wonder if I’ll ever find a place where I belong or if I am fated to die alone. I want to tell people I feel this pain, I want to scream and cry for help. But I can’t. 

My whole life I was always told “there are people with actual problems” or “we have bigger things to worry about then you” So I never got the help I needed, I’ve just had to simile and take it, for 19 years. No one cares about me, I am pushed to the back of line when it comes to important. Even my own mother told me to just simile.

Well I am tried of similing and acting like it’s all okay. It’s not, I feel guilt, I feel pain, I feel regret, I lost all my friends, twice. I lost the first person who genuinely loved me back, I lost any hope of knowing what family means, I lost so much. I don’t want to simile anymore.

"Dear Bros: You are not ""a male."" You are a man.","I have noticed a lot of cis bros who are adjusting to this new outlook refer to themselves as ""males."" And I just wanna tell you bros, you don't have to do that. 

My problem with being referred to as ""a male"" is, in short, it's dehumanizing. Being human, to me, means having the awareness to rise above what my biology intended for me. Redpill ideology on the other hand wants you to feel like we are all slaves to biology, because shitty biology is how they attempt to support many of their ideas. 

Nevertheless, we're not in the business of shying away from facts here, I am male (note however that I'm using 'male' as an adjective, and not a noun.) But my maleness is only part of who I am. Yes, my maleness is related to how the species homo sapiens sapiens procreates, but procreation is only one part of sex, and sex is only one part of relationships, relationships are only one part of human interaction, and human interaction is only one part of my life. 

I think some people could see that last part and imagine that I'm attempting to downplay my privilege, but I would argue that my privilege does not come from being male, it comes from being a man. After all, any privilege afforded by male biology is mutable as soon as you stop being a ""real man"" in someone's eyes. 

What I'm getting at is that ""male"" is not a good substitute for man because ""male"" is not the social role I occupy. To play the role of ""male"" would mean that all I'm good for in society is mating with ""females"" (more on that later) and perhaps one or two other primordial obligations. And I think there's a reason Redpill ideology does this even beyond it's obsession with (inaccurate) biology, and it's that cults work best when they can break you down before building you up. Redpill recruitment works best when its targets lack confidence, and hammering in this idea that we're not men, but rather ""males"" will reinforce the idea that if we're not ""conquering females"", we're failing. 

It's much harder to recruit self-actualized men into that thought system because they will implicitly understand 1) that they're on the receiving end of a bullshit sales pitch, and 2) they don't have to worry about what pathetic snake oil salesmen think about their sex life. 

There's nothing wrong with the word ""male"" as a noun. I think it's perfectly fine when talking about birds and fish and mammals. And it's fine as an adjective as well. But it's not a noun you need to use to describe yourself, bros. You're more than that. 

Oh, I promised a word on calling women ""females"" didn't I? Well here it is: stop.",bropill,1600131557,WeaselSounds,41,1,True,2020-09-14
Completely overwhelmed by E learning and its taking a toll on me,"For background I'm a sophomore in highschool and I started about a month and a half ago and its genuinely making me regret everything.

I've always kinds been an overachiever in school since I was young because I was put in the ""gifted class"" in 4th grade. The elementary and middle school I went to were very poor and small. In total my 8th grade class was around 80 or so people while all of the surrounding middle schools were in the 100's. I was a big fish in a small pond and I kinda coasted on that for many years. I wasn't the smartest kid but I was in the top percentage of my class and I was comfortable. Looking back there was a lot of things I hated about my middle school, namely its size and its lack of options. My middle school at one point was in 15 million dollars of debt and it never really got much better than that, but for the most part it was alright. Until I went to highschool

The highschool I go to is massive, in all senses of the world. It has 4000+ people and multiple buildings and a hundred clubs and sports and it was all incredibly overwhelming especially since all if my friends went to the other highschool in the area. For freshman year I just barely made it out with all A's and a caffeine dependency that I weaned off of during the summer. I thought that sophomore year was going to be fine, I had friends to help me and peer tutors to assist. And then elearning happened

Over the last month and a half I've had to teach myself my 3 separate AP courses and my honors precalc class basically on my own while doing 2 clubs, drivers ed and cross country and it's really starting to kill me. I get to bed every night at the earliest by 11-12 and very often 2-3 while still having to walk my dogs at 6 every morning. I sit in front my iPad for school 7 hours a day and then I have hours of extra curricular and homework to do afterwards. I am so very overwhelmed and e learning has worsened it significantly.

What I hate about my highschool which my teachers acknowledge and yet do little to fix is its individualistic atmosphere. In my highschool you either float or sink and if you sink everything falls apart. It's so competitive and stressful and without having my friends or anyone else there to help me I feel like I'm carrying this burden of schoolwork everywhere I go. I'm just barely staying afloat and no matter how long or hard I work theres always an assignment I missed or a quiz I have the next day. My school is so indifferent to whether or not I fail and it ingrained this idea into me that if I fail it's my fault and part of me beleives it. I feel lazy whenever I go to sleep at a decent time or if I take a break from my work and I feel miserable knowing I havent finished all my work. Even now I feel dizzy from trying to stay awake.

I've had to shove off some of my other responsibilities too to keep up with this work. I dont talk to my friends much on the weekdays and I dont spend anytime reading for pleasure anymore. Also since my mom is always out of the house the bulk of house cleaning and chores fall on me and due to all of the shit above that being neglected too.

I dont know how much longer I can do this without collapsing. I just wish I had a friend to lean on. But I dont I feel so alone.

How do I organize all my goals?,"I have a lot of goals I've been building up in my mind. Getting more fit, eating healthier, journaling, keeping up socially, keeping up personal hygiene, maintaining an organized living space, transitioning to college, and more.

It's just that whenever I think of tracking goals and working everyday towards them. It can seem so overwhelming that I have these goals. A lot of these goals aren't very hard and just seem like basic tasks everyone else can juggle with ease, but I just find it so difficult to not let one of my tasks slip while focusing on another. When I exercise, perform my skincare routine, and text friends, I just don't have the energy to clean up my room before it gets worse.

Maybe I'm just lazy or not neurotypical, but I'd like to hear ways other people organize tasks. I've tried ToDoist (a to do list app), but too often I enter a bunch of stuff and never do look at it later because I'm scared to get overwhelmed by looking at it.

I tried to confront her about this and she just told me that she doesn't know what's going on.

"I’m currently detoxing from the Red Pill, but I still have low self-esteem, and ridden with many insecurities. What can I do?","I’m 22 years old. I had been on TRP for the last few years. I grew up kind of bullied and picked on, raised by parents that should’ve been divorced, surrounded by traditionally masculine males in the family, and spent too much time on video games and on my ass. Despite being 6’4, I’ve resulted in someone with low self esteem and confidence, and insecurities. For a long time I had a forever alone mindset cause I felt incredibly ugly. Through use of TRP I was able to look better physically, though I still describe myself as ugly. At times I feel like a ogre tbh. 

Nonetheless, I don’t think about it too much cause through Tinder, Bumble, and FB dating I’ve been able to through lots of dates. In total I’ve gone out with 50 different girls, mostly Tinder. But I’ve gotten rejected by most of them. Like almost all. Of those 50 I’ve slept with 21 girls but probably only gotten 10-13 second dates. Only 3 have led to something more meaningful. Though I’ve never had a girlfriend. 

Point is most girls don’t like me, and most of the time I’ve seen as the one time dude who they fuck simply cause they’re already there on the date so they might as well. And I know why, I have this very boring personality. Like, I’m not likeable or desirable. I have this serious full demeanor about me. I don’t say stuff charismatically or excitable. I’m not this super fun guy with social status. In fact I have zero social status. 

All of this has made me very insecure. Not to mention that I’m in my head waaaaayyy too much during dates. I concern myself with trying too act non-needy, not desperate. So at times I’ve trying to conjure up this aloof and IDGAF image about me during dates that I don’t find myself in the moment. Something tells me this also preventing me from connecting with people. 

Then you always read about it how girls can sense insecurity and thirst, and that itself makes me overthink even more. 

Every time I’m on a date with a girl I feel like I’m out with a Nazgul! Like they can sense all my negative thinking and insecurities. And I have to try my best to appear confident. It’s soooo easy to get dates for me. Shit I once went on 8 dates in the span of 2 weeks. But I always fuck it up. I’ve been scared to go on dates lately for that reason.

Worst part is, there’s this girl I’ve been dating since February. We’re not official. But she means a lot to me. I took her virginity, so I think I mean something to her. But I’m not sure why she likes me at all. I’m afraid she’s just attached now cause I was her first but soon she’ll come to see I’m just some boring average dude who clearly has insecurity and low confidence then eventually dump me. Whenever I date someone in a more serious manner, all these issues I mention are amplified x10. I feel like at times I’m way more concerned with my issues and I’m not properly enjoying this beautiful thing I have with this girl. 

I have fixed some of my external issues, leading my more dates. And I’ve improved since 2017 where I was a complete incel. But I’ve realized that my internal issues have made no improvement. In fact I feel like it’s gotten worse. Because of TRP I feel like in order to be a man who gotta be this perfect stoic and jacked man for girls to like you. So my self esteem has gotten worse when I compared myself to an image like that. I’m always comparing myself to other men and seeing how much better they are than me.

I feel like I am a pathological narcissist,"Hey Bros!

This is my first post here. This has been a common theme on my mind lately. I feel like I may have narcissistic personality disorder, and am a covert narcissist. While I feel like I might, I know I probably am not because the thing about NPD is you have to be unaware of how narcissistic you are. But here is a list of examples and red flags I’ve noticed are lacking empathy for my brother. He has been having serious mental health issues and while I feel bad for him, my compassion is very limited. When I heard that he was hospitalized I was confused but I was almost annoyed. I thought “that sucks” but I didn’t lose sleep over it. I cared but not in a normal way 

A few weeks ago I was visiting my 16 year old cousin and he asked me for dating advice. Instead of telling him truthfully that I’ve never dated before at the age of 21, I exaggerated my experience with a female friend, telling him that we hooked up when in reality I was only friends with this person and I’m still a virgin. He was really impressed by what I told him and I felt really good about myself. A part of me said you probably shouldn’t have lied to your cousin but I brushed it off and felt overall very empowered.

I am also a musician and I’ve been semi professional and been able to support myself from playing music before . I constantly fantasize about how successful I will be and how I will be superior to my peers. 

My uncle and aunt on my moms side (my moms Siblings) seem to contain narcissistic traits. My uncle always brags about how much more successful he has been or smart he is in comparison to other family members. He also brags about how he’s lied and manipulated in order to get through life. He has also ranted aggressively to me and my brother (usually individually) about these topics and he’s sometimes very condescending. 

I honestly think it’s unlikely I actually have NPD since I have self awareness but I have some narcissistic traits to my personality. I feel positive sometimes but my brain finds a way for me to get back into negative and narcissistic mindsets like it is just a part of my brain now. I’ve also been stuck in Red Pill and Incel thought patterns for a few months now which probably have fueled these aspects. 
Any advice of What should I do to help get out of these types of behaviors?",bropill,1600502741,TC-Wheeler,22,1,True,2020-09-19
My thoughts on me potentially fetishising Asian women,"I hope this will make sense and that this is the right sub to post this. I’m in my early twenties from a European country. Through American media I’m aware of this stereotype that some white men fetishise Asian women, now, in my country that stereotype doesn’t really exist, probably in part because there are, by percentage of the population, fewer Asian people compared to the USA or Canada. Also, through listening and talking to other guys my age, I have found that a lot of guys aren’t attracted to Asian women, period. However, that is only anecdotal, and not necessarily representative of the population of my country at large. Additionally, and this is just my opinion, disregarding an entire race, or ethnicity, or nationality in dating is kind of weird and a whole different story.

Now coming back to me, years ago (roughly late 2016 to early 2017) I developed a crush on one of my classmates who is of Vietnamese descent, at that point I had been a classmate of hers for 1,5 years. I didn’t like the fact that I had a crush on her and that was because I, first of all, didn’t know how to handle those kinds of feelings and because I feared, having heard of the aforementioned stereotype, that I was fetishising her (more on that later). So, I didn’t know what to do and after a few months I told my best friend about my crush (she actually caught on to it herself and I just confirmed it) and I told another close friend, I told him directly though. By autumn of 2017 I asked her out on a date and she said no. Then I started working on getting over her, which I really only managed to do by summer of 2018 when we all went off to university. But since developing this crush and especially since asking her out, I’ve been asking myself whether or not I fetishised her and if I fetishise Asian woman in general. 

I started looking up what it means to have “yellow fever” and one thing that was mentioned all the time was that men who fetishise Asian women think that they are naturally submissive. Now, I don’t think that Asian women are naturally submissive, obviously, that, of course, has (partly) to do with the culture someone grows up in and is raised in and since the West is generally more liberal than Asian countries, women raised in western countries won’t be as submissive as these guys might like. Also, I want to be in an equal relationship so I’m not interested in that. 

My interaction with (East) Asian culture has been somewhat superficial. I watched quite a bit of Anime growing up (as so many did) and read A LOT of manga, however, I’ve grown out of that and don’t watch or read either anymore. I also listened to K-Pop for some time just to check it out, since it became relatively popular outside of Korea, however, it’s not something I listen to regularly. I am quite interested in China and read a lot about Chinese history and politics because I’m interested in those topics anyway and because China is such a huge country that we in the West don’t really understand (that’s my opinion at least). I thought that maybe my interest in these countries is indicative of yellow fever but I am interested in other countries in general. Also, the fact that I like something doesn’t necessarily mean that I fetishise it.

So, I don’t necessarily think that there is fetishising on my part, however, this sort of stuff can manifest itself differently, I suppose. I’m mainly thinking about this stuff since I have somewhat low self-esteem and I am, because of that, also a bit impressionable. So, when I hear this sentiment repeated every now and then I get paranoid and think: “Am I like that?” The thought that I might be like that horrifies me, because I think fetishising someone like that is one of the worst things you can do to somebody. Not seeing them for who they are and not caring about the actual person is terrible. 

I have never articulated this thought, and I have a hard time writing it down without it becoming too convoluted. I’m sorry if it’s hard to understand, if the wording or the punctuation is weird (I still struggle with that sort of stuff in English). I probably could have left some things out but I’m just going to leave my thoughts as they are. I don’t even know what I want to gain from posting this. I’m too much in my head sometimes so maybe somebody else reading this will help me. It’s just that this stuff, especially reading it back to myself now, fills me with a deep sense of shame.",bropill,1600534164,Orioram,5,1,True,2020-09-19

"Once in a while, the effect working all the time in my 20's comes out of nowhere and bites me on the ass.","I'm damn proud of the work I did in my 20's, and I'm only successful now in my 30's because I got sick of being sad and feeling like I was missing out all the time and forced myself out the door.

I look back on that with pride. I finally saw opportunities for what they were and took them instead of wishing I was bold enough to take them. I grabbed with both hands and didn't let go until I wanted to. At times it felt like I'd ""beaten"" it, as though the work, exercise, and studying couldn't stop me, and it all made me stronger.

Now with more distance, time, stability, and forced quarantine I'm seeing the downside. No matter how afraid I was of people I went forth with an open mind and attitude, but so many of the people I met just saw me as someone from work, and my insistence on seeing the best in people meant I'd blinded myself to shit like people who would gladly undermine anyone, or would string me along, or treated everything with contempt.

It's hard to explain but that job was very public-facing so I got to meet *a lot* of people all the damn time. For years no matter what room I walked into I knew someone there.

But my suspicions are confirmed now. I was just some guy. I wasn't their friend no matter how often I saw them.

I've been trying to cut them out, by deleting them on social media, but there's so many of them, and I feel like too many people know me as just that annoying guy now.

So now I'm stuck with this crazy dichotomy. If I didn't get that first job my career wouldn't have been successful and I'd probably be some jibbering homeless person now. But succeeding at that job meant sacrificing connections, and trying to maintain my sanity by not falling into my old mindset made me think I was friends with people who don't think of me as even an acquaintance. 

Months ago before the pandemic I'd started to come to this realization so I started changing how I acted around people. One night when I was out at a bar with some chick who was stringing me along and her roommate, I saw someone who I'd thought was a friend a couple of tables over.

She either didn't see me or pretended to not see me, so I did the same. As the night went on her body language got weird. It was weird; before, if I'd seen her, I would have greeted her, probably gotten a short ""hey"" and been ignored by her, but this night it looked like she was leaning away from our table. When she passed mine a couple of times it was with that sort of dead-armed walk people get when they think they're walking casually. She could have said something but she didn't. I didn't pretend to not see her and didn't say anything either.

Any tips for dealing with having a 'weird' penis?,"So not to overshare too much but I've got a condition called phimosis where my foreskin is too tight so it cant retract fully. So not only am I uncircumcised (a rarity in the good 'ol US of A), but I have a particular condition that makes my dick function differently inherently. A few months ago I was getting it on with a girl and when she saw my dick she got so freaked out about it that she called it off then and there, leading to me having to throw my clothes back on while assuring her that its okay for her to make that decision (no consent is no consent, no matter the reason). And while I thought it was funny at first (still is a bit, honestly) it's caused me to become even MORE self conscious about my dick, cause I'm not hung by any streych of the imagination and I've always felt bad about not being able to please the girl I'm with as well as I could with just a couple more inches tacked on.

So in my card I told her I loved her and that she should also try making some time for herself.

I just cried for the first time in over 7 months,"I've struggled with my mental health a lot, and it's very difficult for me to cry. Like, I can have a complete mental breakdown without being able to shed a tear. Last night, my roommates and I had a conversation about what pisses us off about each other, and it ended up mostly being about how they get irritated with my inability to understand social cues (I genuinely try to catch them, but I absolutely can't do it). I didn't want to show it in front of them, but it really hurt. 

This morning, I talked about it with one of my friends. I mentioned that I could really use a hug, and she actually hugged me. At some point, I started crying into her shoulder. She asked me how long it had been since I'd really hugged someone, and I realized that I couldn't remember the last time I'd hugged someone.

What do I do when I belive I am depressed and I'm only 21?,"The past few months have just been on repeat: work, lift weights in my backyard, and time wasters (reddit, youtube, ig). I eat healthy and stay in shape but not much else good is going on in my life.

I very quickly lose motivation in anything new I want to try. I haven't looked foreward to anything in months. My biggest dopamine rushes are food and jerking off when I get home from work. I honestly have way more negative and self-hating thoughts now than I ever did before.  Feelings like I'm not enough and that I am wasting my youth.

I have utter feelings of being pathetic for having 0 dating experience at 21. I missed the ""right of passage"" when most people were learing about sex and relationships when they were younger. And I feel like I wouldn't be able to find a girl similar to me. And I entirely believe finding a partner would bring me happiness, even though they say its bad to have that mentality.

I have very low self esteem and don't even have any confidence to meet girls. And don't think any girl would wanna date me anyway. Seeing couples just makes me sad.  They have had experiences for years that I may never have.

My biggest source of unhappiness is having 0 friends. I had friends on campus before classes were put online in march, but I live out of state and have 0 friends in my hometown.
I feel creepy going out in public with intentions of trying to make new friends. There are zero events I would feel comfortable going to because I would be going alone since I have no friends. No bars, no concerts, etc. Who the fuck goes to these things alone. Just a creepy loner. Literally if I was just put in a social situation with friends I would feel happy and wanted. I'm not choosing to not have friends, its that I don't know how to get friends.

I haven't lived the life a 21 should have. I'm boring. People my age have had crazy adventures, romances, milestones, developed social skills, and I have none of that. I endlessly compare myself negitively to others. I should really delete social media, but then people will think I'm even weirder.

Tell Me Why (game) and transphobic reactions,"hey bros

so recently a new game came out, from the same company that made life is strange. life is strange is a game that helped bring me out of a very dark place... might have saved my life even. this new game is similar in format and style, with a new story (i havent even played yet). one of the main characters is trans which i think is wonderful, seeing trans struggles make it into an amazing game. the problem is the reviews... i know its kinda stupid to complain but just scrolling thru the comments and seeing everything from ""this game is nothing but political propoganda"" to things like kill all trans people. it just hurts to see this shit...

if anyone has the game can we work to fight back against the bigots that are doing this shit?",bropill,1598679649,cloneguyancom,43,1,True,2020-08-28
Another sub has turned transphobic and this one really hurts,"Advice to trans, non binary, intersex, or gender nonconforming bros who experience menstruation: don't go to r/periods. Recently someone made a post saying that not all people who have periods are women, and although it did get quite a few upvotes the comments are hateful and not worth sifting through. Now there are a couple of transphobic posts up, and the mods haven't responded at all. The sub has no rules against transphobia. This hurts, so bad. When I got my first period I was ecstatic because I felt that I was finally feminine, and I was overjoyed to join subs like that one and feel that I was finally a part of the ""women"" club.

Why does nudity always have to be sexualized?,"Why do we have to overtly sexualize nudity? I certainly get that nudity is a big part about sexual expression, and that it commonly associated with sex, but why is it automatically perceived as sexual? I've had a ton of girlfriends tell me that they change in front of each other all the time and it isn't wierd for them. Some stories they tell me are them litteraly just flashing each other, either to be more comfortable with each other, or to just show off. I've heard so many stories of straight girls taking showers together, changing together, or just being nude around each other and they don't feel uncomfortable. 

So why is it different for guys?

My guy friends get so uncomfortable around other near nude guys. I know its all different strokes for different folks (hehe), But I don't get why guys get so wierd around other naked guys. Me and my guys friends make HELLA gay jokes and comments to each other, but as soon as it comes to even going to the urinal, they get all wierd about stuff.

I get that nudity will make some people uncomfortable, but I also kinda don't get it. The human body is beautiful in every shape in size. The nude female body is gorgeous, and the nude male body is breath-taking. Every body is gorgeous, and we're all human, so why do we feel so uncomfortable being nude around each other?

I just want a hug,"I’m so overwhelmed, I don’t know how to handle all of this happening at once.

This all happened in the past two weeks.

1. My birth father died from Covid. He left my mom crying on the sidewalk outside of a restaurant after she told him she was pregnant with me, and I’ve only spoken to him a couple times over the phone. His wife, who was separated from him for two months when he died, called me to tell me that his deceased parents were sitting on a huge trust fund that I’d be entitled to. My mom is pushing me to talk to lawyers and get a bunch of shit done on the off chance that I could get a bunch of money but honestly I’m just upset that I never got the chance to get to know him.

2. My cousin died from an asthma attack. My stepdad was rushing him to the hospital when he died. He is blaming himself and is telling everyone in the family he’s going to commit suicide. My stepdad abused me growing up. I haven’t even spoken to him in over a year, since he attacked my brother in the middle of our grandma’s funeral simply because we refused to speak to him.

3. My girlfriend broke up with me. She said she wasn’t attracted to me anymore and just wants to be friends.

4. I was offered my dream job. But that means I have to move 500 miles away to start this job immediately, in the midst of all of this happening. My (I guess now ex) girlfriend lives in the town I’m moving to.

Dying my hair?,"Hey bros! 23M here

I've been thinking about dying my hair (not completely, ideally just a streak or something like that) for more than a year now, but I can't come around to actually asking a hairdresser to do it.

Part of it is because I can't decide on a color, or a specific dyeing pattern or any other specifics.

The other part is the anxiety to be told off or frowned upon by whomever will actually do the dyeing.

The funny thing is, I'm not someone who usually cares what other people think. If my hair were dyed, I wouldn't worry for a second about what anyone thinks about it. It's the ""asking"" that really makes me nervous, and I can't really tell why. It doesn't make sense and I hate that it is keeping me from being more expressive in my appearance.

Breakups are hard. That's okay,"Hey bros

Breakups are hard. I had my first breakup 3 months ago, the relationship lasted a year and a half. 

You love him/her to death, you spent most of your time with this person and all of the sudden it's cut off. Ofcourse that hurts like a bitch, and it takes a long time to heal.

I just want to share with you all a little bit of what I've learned going through this.

The most important thing to remember is:
It's perfectly fine to miss a person so goddamn much, and not want them back.
I learned that focusing on the fact that I was missing them every single minute of every single day made me feel very negative. Like I was lacking what made me really happy. It didn't once come up in my many thoughts that not the entire relationship was perfect (which it obviously wasn't, otherwise we wouldn't have broken up). I was only thinking about the good things. Of which there are a vast majority, but still.

Maybe you weren't compatible, maybe something came up. Maybe you made a big mistake. That's okay. You're human. Learn from it, and try to move on.

It's only recently that I've started to feel like I'm a complete person by myself again. That I can be happy just by myself. But really, that's the most important thing to realize.

I'm not over my relationship yet and I probably won't be for a while. But I'm just starting to feel like I'm moving forward a little bit so I wanted to share that with you all.

I lost a friend today and it's been brewing for a while. I don't know how to respond or how to get over it.,"So during High School I had this friend.  At first I kinda picked on her, traded barbs whatever (I was very immature) but over time she became a friend of mine.  Highlight of my day was seeing her from time to time.  She even kept me going through a pretty dark period of my life, even if she didn't know it.  We bantered about school, class whatever.  It was highschool and I had made a friend on my own.  

Time passes and college comes up, she's there and I'm there (which community college sure as fuck humbled my ass).  We stuck together and hung out, supported each other through classes ect.   At a certain point last summer, we decided to get together.  She found me cute and liked me since 10th grade which is a fucking shock to my system and looking back makes a lot of my actions seem really immature and petty.

While I didn't know we were together for a few weeks (yep straight up Seinfeld plot), I was happy.  We were going back to school and I felt able to talk to her about anything.  She was the first girl, hell the first person I was ever super emotionally honest with.  I told her everything, deepest fears, likes, dreams, anxieties ect.  

But at a certain point, I knew I was putting more into the relationship than she was.  I would bring her McDonalds and other stuff when I knew she was struggling and made as much of an effort as I could to do things like a good boyfriend, but sometimes I couldn't get any response and she never did the same for me.  Like I know people show love differently but at a certain point, I was doing more.  And I know why, she was working constantly, some depression, had bad past relationships and had a bad view of sex (childhood preachers are apparently dicks).

But I needed intimacy, emotional and physical and she couldn't provide that.  She gave me several outs and I was too dumb to realize what she wanted.  

She dumped me on Christmas Eve.

We met up again on January 4th, both of us still hoping to be friends.  I cried in front of her and said I felt alone.  I didn't want to get back together but I needed support.  My parents wanted me to separate entirely and I didn't trust my other friends enough so I was super desperate to keep her around.  I think this was accidental emotional blackmail looking back at it and something I want to take back.  She was just glad I didn't hate her.

We decided that it could work and eventually she got me a job where she worked (fast food) (we rarely saw each other at school and wanted to stay in each others lives).  But I also suck as an employee and she was very jobbed focus.  We hung out from time to time and for a second there we had that pre relationship friend banter back but it didn't last.

As time went on we were talking to each other less and less, and eventually after getting fired (me not her), we barely talked at all.

As time went on with the virus and everything I tried to reach out but she was distant.  I got one more conversation and then nothing.

She said we grew apart and we didn't have anything in common anymore.  And like that she was out of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I did anything wrong (I imagine a fuck ton) but that isn't how relationships work, I just hoped I had a bit more agency in my first break up.  It was also the first time I really lost a friend that I really cared about.

I'm not sure which I cared more about, losing her as a girlfriend or losing her as a friend.  Either we she was cool and nice and I liked being around.  I guess the feeling wasn't mutual.

Looking back I still like her.  I don't hate her or even resent her.  I just feel really bad about everything.

I know I messed up, I should have separated after she dumped me and I shouldn't have been so emotionally needy all the time and then just suddenly shut up about it because I didn't want that to be the only aspect to the friendship.  But as it stands there is nothing I can do about it.  I can't control her agency nor do I want to.  I just feel like I lost mine.

Anyway this has just been a rant about a failed relationship I don't even know if this belongs here.  I talked to a friend of mine while writing this and he helped me work through a bit of my feelings so thats cool.  I don't know any advice for old girlfriends/friends who drift apart in which you tried to keep everything together.

I don't even know if this all happened the way I said it did.  I hope I came out unbaised and that I wasn't painting her in a bad light or anything.  I just needed to get this out because I feel sad and these are new feelings that I don't know how to deal with right now.

I feel like i don't really need to list out all the things wrong with the world today, as im pretty sure that most of you are under the weight of some of them.

One of them that i'd like to speak on though is how fucking isolating existance can be. We become numb, or injured, and a lot of us we just don't have the support systems that help us to get through all the things life throws at us. Even when we know others are out there, just like us, who we can connect with on a human level, actually building that connection which a lot of us long for so so desperately just seems unacheivable. For some people, life can get so confusing, like such a inescabable, miserable, foggy maze that the best we can do is just survive, hoping for a better future, stumbling foward day after day. There are so many pitfalls that we can slip into in trying to find a way towards that sense of community, that sense of love for others and ourselfs, that when we fall into them hoping to finally taste that thing we've been seeking, it only turns into more hurt being felt by us or someone else; racism, classism, sexism, exploitation of each other, whatever. I guess all im trying to say is that I really fucking love you guys, because eveytime I see a depressing post about someone who's suffering, there's dozens of yall who try your very best to help that person with encouragement, kind words, advice, or whatever way you can. That's such a rare, but beautiful thing to find on the internet.

Please help me help my brother get friends; my mom is threatening to stop funding his uni studies if he doesn't change his attitude.,"TL;DR: My brother has no friends and isn't interested in getting any, but my family is getting more and more annoyed with him. I don't think it's super healthy either, but I want to help without shouting his head off.

Hey folks, I'm here because I'm desperate, I hope I'm allowed to post this here, I'm sorry but I have to ask someone.
My parents just had a huge fight with my brother [24M] over his social life, or lack thereof. 

So story time: my brother is quite introverted, but also really stubborn and absent-minded. He didn't really have friends in primary school (but I don't blame him for that, most people's p.school friendships don't last), but as far as we know, he had some friends in high school. 

I say ""as far as we know"", because he doesn't talk much about anything, except politics maybe. He's now in law school, but things didn't change, he doesn't go out, we don't know what he does at uni.

He's never had a girlfriend (I know he's straight). He also wants to lose weight but idk why?? He's 183 cm, 77kg, he's just fine, tall, and handsome.

Now all this has our parents (and increasingly everybody else in the family) worried. He also talks to our parents in a really mean way? Like yeah, they're a bit conservative, mom's a big homophobe (though I'm the one who has to deal with that anyways), but otherwise they help us a lot, pay for our studies, we've never had to take up a job ever! They even bought a small flat in the captial where we can stay during uni and then we'll sell it and divide it between us ffs!!! We've never lacked anything, so like, behaving in a normal way with them is the minimum, no?

So recently my brother's taken up listening to videos with headphones on. Everywhere: in the car, on the bus. He never wakes up before 12 and goes to sleep at around 3 am. He spends the rest of the day in his room, only comes down to eat. Because of this, he rarely knows anything that's happening in the family, what family events we have to attend, etc., which is a bit annoying. 

Today he made the mistake of coming down to ""breakfast"" at 12, with headphones on. Mom wanted to say something to him, he didn't react, twice. And mom lost it.

She threatened to stop funding his uni studies if he doesn't change his attitude. 

I don't know what to do? I introduced him once to my high school friends when they were around, but even then he went up to his room. I'm not the most extroverted bubbly person either, with only a handful of friends, but fuck I wish he just tried. 

He watches a lot of ""Breadtube"", which is fine, I do too, but aside from gaming, this, and politics are his only hobbies. And I'm gonna sound like a lib, but you won't have friends with that. He's just actively disinterested in anything else, it feels like.

And like, the thought that he's gonna finish uni in like a year, and then has to live on his own with no friends terrifies me. Because of his habits we wouldn't really know what he's up to either.

And like, he just came home from the capital after a week, and said that he really enjoyed being alone and not having to deal with us. And when I said that it made me sad that he hadn't missed us, he just shrugged.

Worst thing is that there's the friggin virus around, so there are no events and it's really dangerous to go out, but it doesn't matter to mom because she's just as stubborn as him. And law school is also fucking hard so, yeah.

He also lacks some social skills, thougb he has improved, but like, he's almost 25 now. Doesn't plan ahead, e.g. to get home to our village, we have to change buses but he never checks if there are any direct connections? So he's willing to like wait for hours instead of bothering to check the schedule. Mom has to book hairdresser appointments for him, etc.

Can someone help? Has someone been like this, but overcame it? I can't even bring this up with him without it escalating into a shouting match. Is he depressed? Is he on the autism spectrum? What's wrong? Or is my family collectively overreacting and I'm going insane over nothing? I really love him, but I don't know what to do.",bropill,1599306935,pynkszmi,39,1,True,2020-09-05

I wish people would say nice things about the way I look,"I know that title sounds shallow and all but it's not about that. I've always kinda felt self conscious about my appearance. I kinda dislike the way I look, my nose is too big and my smile too wide, I always look tired and I'm tall and lanky. I hate my legs the most in general. I have pretty bad acne despite having a full skincare routine. I also dress like what I can best describe as a mix between a mormon youth pastor and a cowboy impersonator. I recognize that all of this sounds pretty unremarkable but more and more over quarantine my appearance it's starting to bother me and today it was kinda at it's worse.

Today I was just scrolling through my feed on Instagram and I came across a friend of mines post. She was just posing in the picture normally and for the first time something kinda struck me. As I was looking through the comments I saw almost every single one complimenting her and her looks. Most of my friends are girls and when I thought about it I realized that while any one of their posts were flooded with other friends complimenting their appearance but I cant remember a single time I'd been told that I looked nice. This isnt to bash any of them I think it's a wonderful thing to compliment your friends and I don't want to sound like I'm jealous about it. I also realize for the most part it's my fault for never talking to my friends about this and lately I've worked to become indifferent to how I look and dress but man I just wish I felt good about my looks.

 I feel like I always have to be jokey about how I look and I've heard my fair share of humor directed over my appearance. Not that I resent it I mean I I definetly lean into the joke and am willing to make myself the butt of the joke and usually it doesn't bother me, But sometimes I really do feel like I cant be honest that I wish people would have something nice to say.

A bro who’s a valuable person, because of the good you’ve done your best to put into the world. 

If you feel like you don’t have any utility, or useful skills, or meaningful relationships, it *might* be due to some things you need to examine for yourself. We are all unlearning toxic behaviors. But most likely, it’s our society’s toxic mentality of rugged individualism that’s isolating you the most. housing, the labor market, consumer products- all these things gear us to become atomized more and more. Things like cooking, storytelling, and labor were communal. 
In contrast, we now have doordash, Netflix, and remote work. These aren’t the root of all evil, but they’re reflective of a society that encourages social isolation. In a different world, you’d probably feel deeply connected to a community that you could derive some meaning from. Us all being alone, together, isn’t a natural state of things- pandemic aside.

My ancestors lived in tenement housing on sugar cane plantations for generations. We were treated as subhuman. But we kept our humanity through shared experiences; our tightly bound lifestyles. And when my family was freed, we maintained our communities through congregation and closeness. Don’t forget what supporting each other means. It’s the purest form of self actualization.

How do i initiate and flirt in dating?,"I keep reading and i still don't understand how to do it. It's so confusing i feel like i'd be harassing a woman if i said something flirty, romantic or even worse sexual. Touching her? Are you out of your mind?? That'd be so wrong and inappropriate. Then there's the issue of meeting women at all. I miss the gym, but i do remember that when i used to gym before corona there weren't many women there, and even if there were i still wouldn't because i have been told that talking with women in the gym is inappropriate. Gym is pretty much the only place i see other people, then there's martial arts back when we could do that haha. As for martial arts mostly just men 20-30 and kids from 7-14. 

But yes anyhow, flirting, dating, confusing, don't know how, what i'm creepy or do it wrong or make her feel uncomfortable like all other men do to women? Women get approached a lot every day like a lot IRL and on internet. Then there'd go and bother women like all other men do if i started dating or interacting with women.",bropill,1599508018,Errorwrongpassword,50,1,True,2020-09-07
What does a relationship actually look like?,"Hi bros!

I [15M] just got together with my girlfriend [14F] a couple days ago. Neither of us have been in a proper relationship before, so we don’t know what to do now (or at least, I don’t know what to do. I haven’t talked to her about it).

I honestly don’t even know how I got a girlfriend. I used to be so dumb and ugly. I think I’ve fixed the dumbness and ugliness somehow, but I still don’t know how to flirt. 

Anyway, I just wanted to ask for you bros to explain to me what people actually do in a relationship at my age, and maybe also how to flirt with her lol.

I don’t have anyone to go to,"hey bro’s.

the group of friends im close with has a few people in it (myself included) who deal with depression and suicidal thoughts. im pretty close with all of them, so im able to pretty well understand their feelings, and for those of them which im not as close with ive talked with friends about it and they’ve filled me in on them a bit.

anyways, as the oldest in the group (18) ive sort of filled the role as the older brother, or at the very least as the responsible one. I’ve had very lengthy conversations with them about their feelings, I’ve had them open up to me about deep and personal things, I’ve had them cry in front of me, etc. 

I don’t have anyone like that. My own emotions are just as completely fucked as theirs and I have no one to share them with. If I’m feeling overwhelmed to the point where I just want to die I can’t tell anyone. I can’t text one of them and be like “I really just want to milk myself” because I’m the one who needs to look strong in front of them. I know that’s a lie people make themselves believe, but I just can’t tell them that. They know I’m depressed snd that I’ve gone through some rough patches, but I’ve underplayed how bad it really is because I’m afraid of them knowing.

I’ve opened up about other things to the one I’m closest with, but again, I don’t think I really let on how bad it is, because I don’t want them to worry about me. I’m fine with talking to them about other issues, but this is just one I don’t want them really knowing about.

I know I’ve trapped myself in this corner, but I feel like it’s the only option. I need to be strong for them, but it’s just so difficult. I want someone to treat me the way I treat them, to let me cry and tell me they care about me and help me feel better, but I don’t have anyone like that. I don’t feel safe going to anyone and telling them I need help- I’m the one people go to for that. 

I can’t even contemplate killing myself because there are too many people relying on me and who I’d hurt doing that. It’s too much.",bropill,1599535701,TradeGuineapigPicsPM,6,1,True,2020-09-07

Any time I get angry at someone, even over the most minor thing, I feel weirdly tempted to lash out at them, be that by yelling at them, slapping/grabbing them, or generally just getting sort of violent. I’m not sure why this is the case, but I can’t help but feel that this isn’t normal, because most people I know don’t get worked up over small things. Whatever it is, it genuinely scares me a bit, because I find myself sort of imagining actually hurting the person.

How do I know if I've got depression?,"Hi,

For a while now, my friends have been suggesting that I had depression. At first, I resisted this thinking that there wasn't anything wrong with me and that seeing a doctor would be a waste of time. However, I have since thought that maybe they are right but I still feel like I'd be wasting the doctor's time because I'm not sure that what I'm feeling is depression. 

A lot of the time I don't really feel anything. During the lockdown, I've played a lot of video games but they haven't made me happy at all. I've enjoyed playing them somewhat but they don't make me happy. It's like it's simply a better way to pass the time. Doing things like walking make me feel better but it's more like feeling less down not more up. I don't feel happier. I do, sometimes, get into more intense periods where I will feel really down about a particular thing such as something I don't like about myself or a situation in my life. This happens, at most, a few times a week so it's far from a constant thing. I am not suicidal and I have no intention of hurting myself but I do sometimes think ""if I was dead I wouldn't have to deal with this"" but this is fairly rare. I also can't really cry. The last time I cried properly was when my mother died 3 years ago (something I'll address in another paragraph) and I shed a few tears last year when my dad was leaving me at university but other than that I can't cry, even when I want to and I feel like it'll make me feel better. I can often feel the tears come to my eyes but they don't progress any further. 

I've also struggled with motivation. I find it really hard to focus on studying unless there is a deadline to meet. I put off work in order to play video games or eat food even though I'm aware it would benefit me to do the work. I've never been one to enjoy doing homework but it's like it's impossible to try and do now. It's like it's just easier to not work or the path of least resistance. I often put off washing my clothes or going in the shower because I can't be bothered. They always end up getting done but it's often hours later if not days. Sometimes I struggle with getting up on a morning. I'll set my alarm and I'll want to get up but I'll end up lying there for an hour or two on my phone.

I feel like I've become less intelligent. By this I mean that I feel like I've become more forgetful, I struggle to learn new things (partly because I can't focus). Science was always my favourite subject in secondary school and I decided that I wanted to do biology at university but I've lost my zeal for it and now it's just a thing that I do, only mildly more interesting than other subjects. 

I do have a history that may contribute to this. About 5 years ago, I had health anxiety that I received treatment for and doesn't really affect me today. My mother died 3 years ago after a year or two of turmoil that resulted in me living with my father full time and she had several stays in mental health hospitals. This also occured during the time I was doing exams which greatly stressed me. I don't know how much my mother's death has contributed to this but looking back I'd say that all this started around the time things started going wrong in my life. However, this is rarely on my mind so I don't feel as if it's an active part of my mental state even if it caused it though I suppose it could be subconsciously. 

As a side note, I do have a family history of mental illness. My mother had depression when I was growing up and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in the year or 2 before she died. I believe my father has depression as he takes anti depressants but he's never explicitly said he's got it. My paternal grandmother has Bipolar disorder. My maternal aunt has Severe OCD and my Uncle (who died when I was 8) was an alcoholic. My maternal grandfather tried to kill himself several times when I was very young but I'm not really sure of the specific issues that he has. My maternal grandmother has depression. In summary, there is a family history of depression and mental illness.

Writing this all out has actually helped me consider that I should see a doctor but I'd still like your thoughts.",bropill,1599602491,PaddyM998,4,1,True,2020-09-08

Politics and being a bro,"So I'm not sure I'm a good lefty.  Now I'm a pretty new lefty, i've just barely started doing grass roots stuff like phonebanking or donating that kinda stuff.  But I don't know sometimes I never feel like I'm a lefty like other bros.

Like they get really excited about new political stuff that comes out from breadtube while it sometimes feels like more of a chore for me to watch, even the fun ones like Contra or Ollie, and they get this kinda righteous fury kinda thing and I don't.  And it bothers me that I feel that way.  I want to have that fury, I want that excitement, it feels like they believe in something.  I don't want to just do this out of obligation to morality.  I wonder if prejudice or something plays a part, I don't know.  Like reading about this stuff, or watching a lefty video or correcting someones microaggressions never makes me feel manly or excited like ""Fuck Yeah Politics and Praxis"", it makes me feel depressed or having to do work or I want to avoid it for some reason.

Now I want to stress this isn't all the time, I do get excited for political stuff sometimes like when we got a representative or a wrestler got a roving medicinal office in Syria up and running and I don't agree with the Alt-Right at all.

Please tell me sweet caring bros do exist - big trauma with men here,"Hey so I don't exactly know where to begin as I want to share some though feelings I experience right now but I don't want this to be read the wrong way. So disclaimer this is not a post about bashing men, I am just sharing my difficulty and trauma with men because I would like this to change and be proven wrong. 

Basically during my childhood and most of my life I had quite terrible men around me, some where very abusive and it left deep scars. I am working a lot on myself to heal but while healing i also become more and more aware of how fucking scared I am of men and how even with male friends I can get triggered and not fully able to relax and be vulnerable or speak my mind when my boundaries are crossed. This happened today during an argument with a friend and it then sent me into a spiral. 

I was really disappointed because he knows my past and I am both upset he triggered me so much but also i feel shame. It's like whenever I try to explain my trauma around men, people automatically assume it's again a feminazi who is hysterical. But the point of trauma is that it has consequences, I can't force my body not to react, not to go into panic mode and try to defend myself or not shut down. Because I am still healing and I wish men would take this seriously and be conscious about how they treat people with such trauma. I am also sad because I can't share all those vulnerable truth with those male friends because they wouldn't get it or listen. they want me so hard to act normal and don't get I don't have control over my trauma and I already work so hard. I would like a break and be treated respectfully and not be dismissed so easily.

So yeah unsure what kind of response I want here but I like the bro vibe of this subreddit because I got to observe bros here being empathetic and understanding and wanting to be conscious and respectful of people's boundaries and needs. I don't see this much in my life at the moment so I guess I needed to vent and feel more support. Thanks for reading all this!",bropill,1599700062,camouspimouss,39,1,True,2020-09-09
Ended things with my significant other today.,"Bros, 

I broke up with my girlfriend of about 7-8 months. We met when I wasn't living in my current state, but visited somewhat often. Talked, clicked, but she dated someone who lived near her, no blame, naturally. 

Moved back and messaged her. Instantly clicked. She was still with that same guy, but I swagger jacked her from him (wrong to do, my buddy said that would bite me in the ass). We moved in together after about 6-8 weeks of spending every single day together, probably only spent 5 or less days apart since we first kicked it. 

Anyway, she started separating every single aspect of her life from mine, though not necessarily intentionally. Anyway, long story short, it drove me damn crazy and she straight up told me she won't be there for me because she's gotta work on herself. 

So, I dealt for about a month. Decided yesterday, if I'm going to feel so alone, I might as well actually be alone. So, I had to meet me briefly and told her I was done with things. She talked about maybe one day, but whatever.

Want to know something bros? The only thing I'm really stressing about, is what and who she might be doing. In my eyes bros, that means my affection to her is damn near entirely possessive and controlling. I think I'm going to be okay, it was lovely, but we weren't meant. Take things slow bros, communicate with your significant other and certainly never sacrifice your support networks for one person nor allow them to do the same. Exist separately, together respectfully.

Can’t afford clothes for school and sensory issues/anxiety stuff keeps me from wearing most of my wardrobe,"F/14 if it even matters.

I’m going to keep this simple- I’m going into high school and spent a lot of my money ($30) on stationary I needed because I left school in October last year and my friends didn’t Bring a lot of my stuff. My mom said she’d buy me some clothes (pants and tee shirts specifically because I overheat easily and my school has no air conditioning.) however she either forgot or realized she had no money so we ended up with a pack of sports bras (which is something I needed and no longer need so that’s something less to worry about!)

But here’s my problem. I really need more shirts and leggings because I have body issues and a lot of the shirts I have are either crop tops (which have started to make me uncomfortable as of the past year.) or form fitting. I like to look like a box because I don’t like boys looking at me and I just generally prefer not showing my figure at all. And on the other hand I have sensory issues and if something causes discomfort in any way (or sensory overload.) I never touch it again which just limits me to nothing as I then repurpose whatever caused it- usually make it into stuff for my rats.

We really can’t afford anything and especially pants wise I have nothing that isn’t ripped to shreds due to my skateboarding and he fact I have had the same pairs for a few years and obviously have a lot of wear because I’m clumsy and tear everything. And then I also need shoes because I can’t walk around in boots all day- but I can’t fit into women’s and I also ruin shoes fast because my mom buys cheap pairs..

I don’t even know if I want help or just need to vent. But I’m really stressing about all this because school starts in two weeks and I can’t wear much because I don’t own pants, my shorts are way too short and I only own one tee shirt.. if I knew it was this expensive I would have stayed out of school.",bropill,1598285421,EmoGayRat,54,1,True,2020-08-24
I love my dad.,"My State in Australia has gone back into quarantine (it's the longest in the world in pretty sure) and its' the most horrific thing for my mental health to this again. I deal with OCD and depression that really shows during this time. I was sleeping in the evening becuase I was exhausted. he could tell I was off and asked of if I was okay and then gives me a kiss on the cheek when I went to bed. It doesn't seem like much but the amount of support he gives me Is honestly enough. He also works 10 hours a day go pay the bills. I love my dad so much and he is my only family member who gives a shit about my mental health in this time.

love you dad :)",bropill,1598364566,Asterboy17,19,1,True,2020-08-25
Getting closer to a girl.,"Hello bros. Recently I met a girl and I instantly became attracted to her. We've seen only three times with friends but I was just very happy that she was there. Every day we're getting closer and talking more even though we only know each other for a week. We like the same music and we laugh when we talk.

I know for a fact that she finds me attractive and probably would have sex with me (I know that because the day we ""met"" (I already knew who she was) we played a drinking game where everybody was asked intimate questions and she pointed me out as the most good looking dude. Later on she was asked if she would have sex with anyone of us that were there (we were 5 guys) and she drank. I'm pretty sure It was me). When It was my turn I pointed her out as the most good looking girl and I also drank when I was asked if I would had sex with anyone there. She knows I like her. Later of she followed me on twitter (I did the same later) and she continued to show interest in me.

Anyway, the thing is that, although I don't know her that much... I think I've fallen in love. I just can't stop thinking about her. How do I get closer to her without being a creepy or going to fast? I want to go slow but I already had experiences where I just was way to ""slow"" and the girl probably thought I had no interest in her, if you know what I mean. 

We obviously need to know each other more but I'm afraid to either show too much interest or going too slow. Any recommendations to do that or mistakes to avoid? I have little to zero experience with dating...",bropill,1598467766,amljc0,9,1,True,2020-08-26
"Hey bros, I feel like I’m losing friends and I don’t know what to do.","During the summer, I had a lot of fun hanging out with my friends. We all grew closer together, and it was some of the most fun I’ve ever had. Recently though, college started up and we’ve all been busy, with not much time to hang out anymore. This is my first year at this college, and I don’t really have any friends there yet. Right before college started, one of my friends said something about how sometimes I can be needy and annoying. This really hit a pretty deep insecurity of mine, and kind of scared me. Lately I kind of feel like all of us are drifting apart. Ill try to reach out to friends through text to see if we can make plans, but I either get shut down or just kind of ignored. I have been feeling really lonely, and I just can’t stop thinking about what my friend said. I’m just feeling kind of lost. I don’t know what to do.

Been kinda stressed lately and need to let my heart out,"I recently discovered this subreddit, and seeing such a positive community made me comfortable enough to talk about this because I don't really have anybody to talk with this about.

I'm a teenage lady bro (15), just graduated from highschool and going to college after summer vacation.  Quarantine and the entire situation of COVID-19 has been weighing me down but most importantly everybody in my household.

Because of an incident many years ago my mom fell on her head which caused a brain injury. Luckily she wasn't hurt but alot of things she could do weren't possible for her anymore, such as working, taking care of me who at the time was little and overall doing basic activities were very difficult for her. Over time this however got better.

Until march this year when the country I live in got it's first infected. My mom was very calm in the beginning but when the infection rates got higher and higher she started getting incredibly overstimulated and paranoid. My mom is alot on facebook and by alot I meab ALOT. She is quite impressionable so alot of the fake news she reads are taken at face value and absolute fact.

Eventually it got to a point where my mom barely does anything anymore and it's gotten me very worried and stressed out. She's gotten so overstimulated to the point that she lashes out everytime someone disagrees with her or simply proposes to do something.

My main problem is that my mom mainly lashes out at my dad who is equally as worried as me, he tries to help my mom and listen to her as best as he can but from what he has told me it has felt like ""He never does enough."".

I'm quite a sensitive person, and my room is right next to the living room so I can always hear when my mom lashes out, and everytime she does and my parents end up in an argument I just want to crawl under my blanket and cry (how cowardly it may sound).

I don't know how to deal with it to be honest, it emotionally drains me every single day because I feel like I can't talk to my mother. I'm scared that she gets mad or annoyed. I love both my parents dearly and I wish the absolute best for the both of them so I want to help out in the best way I possibly can but I just don't know how.

I'm sorry if this may not be as fitting for this subreddit, I just thought this would be the most suitable and most comfortable place to let my heart breathe for a bit. 

(Ps: I'm sorry for any spelling errors considering English isn't my native language, I'm also quite nervous to post something for the first time)",bropill,1594752364,_J00L_,14,11,True,2020-07-14

Moving forward from my father's death,"So Bros first time showing my face on this subreddit. A fair warning my grammar isn't stellar so just a heads up. 

So little under a year ago I was in my gaming room (it sounds fancy but it's an unfinished basement room). On discord with some friends playing some video games. Suddenly my little sister comes running down the stairs into my room and says ""we have to move dad off of his bed so the paramedics can get to him"" I jump up and bolt to my parents room where I see my mother crying trying to preform CPR on my father. We get him off the bed onto the ground in time for the paramedics to arrive. They took him away to the hospital. We followed after the ambulance but the thing that kept messing with me was the fact his feet were cold. We get to the hospital and to. Save the dramatics we find out he didn't make it. It was the normal mourning process until my mother asked me if I had stolen my little sister Vicodin.(she just had her appendix out) the truth is I didn't touch it and I told my mother as much. I offered to take a drug test if that would make her more comfortable. She declined as she trusted me to tell the truth. But it bothers me that that Vicodin was gone.  I can't help but think my father committed suicide or at the least he was willing to abuse opioids. All this has left me feeling not to good emotionally these last few days. Tbh there isn't really a lot of questions I have to ask. Just any advice on dealing with the thought of your father commiting suicide?

How to find new hobbies and passions ?,"What's up bro's i hope you all doing well. So i made a previous post in this sub and you bro's actually helped me to fight through my procrastination. And i managed to crush my college exams a few day's ago, thanks you all.

But now i face a entirly new challenge, the countless hours were i was busy learning i envisioned my break after the exams like a great thing. But something happened, my pc just stoped working a month ago and instead of giving up i just saw it as a positive thing that i am not distracted anymore by video games. But know that i am done learning i realized that without my computer i can't follow my hobbies. I was trying to make online content and played arround with stuff like unity and blender. Besides gaming i began with producing a year ago but since my pc stopped working i cant even do that.

I fell like after my pc just died my hobbies died if that makes any sense. This opened my eyes to the fact that i don't know how to live right because i am always alone in my room doing stuff while everyone else is outdoors having fun and gathering real life expiriences.

Long Story short i think they live life and i don't.

I always had a small circle of friends and i am not a party guy i dont drink or smoke and i dont use any drugs. So its really hard to relate or be relatable to alot of people in my age (21). That only things outside of being on my pc i did were martial arts and at the moment i lift wights. I think i don't try enough new things so i ask for your advice bro's. 

What hobbies would you guys recommend were i can meet new people and make friends. Or just tell me about the things you enjoy and tell me about hobbies that are rewarding. Anything can really help me. I try to find my calling in life and in my early twenties i want to make as many good expiriences as possible so please help me out bro's.",bropill,1595195208,Valtr-of-Astora,31,6,True,2020-07-19
Need some encouragement bros,"So, I got fired from a job I really loved about a month ago. I was only there for about months, and they didn't really give me much of a reason to fire me other than ""It doesn't seem like you want to be here, so we think it best for the both of us if we let you go."" By that, I think they meant the time I took off (3 days) to go see my family when my grandma died, the 45 minutes that I was late one day when my car got towed, and a short 3 hour morning shift I got sent home from because I was too injured to work (My thumb got bit by a cat and was in the hospital until 3am that night, and couldn't work my Saturday morning shift, but I still showed up anyway. I showed up Monday morning able to work, just not with my thumb). 

Anyway, since then, I've been kind of a wreck. I've struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life, and that job gave me stability. I had the same schedule every week, I knew I would get paid the same time every month, and it wasn't a stressful job. I was finally getting better, and when I got fired, I tanked. 

I found a job after 3 weeks at a warehouse, but with my anxiety I couldn't go more than 2 days. It was so loud you couldn't hear anybody talk unless you shouted, and it gave me several panic attacks. The 3rd morning in a row, I just didn't get out of bed, and I never showed up. 

Then I found another job a few days after that, but it ended up being a really weird job... I just finished my first week training as a chiropractic assistant, and one doctor is a Scientologist, and the other is a Mormon. They do ""tests"" on people by putting pills bottles in their hands and moving their arms around, and then based off the ""results,"" prescribe different supplements that cost upwards of $100. I hate the job, but it's not as bad as the last one. I still have to drive an hour to get there and another hour back, so it takes up a lot of my day especially since it's a 9 &amp; 1/2 hour shift. 

I've been really down because I feel like I am never going to be able to follow my dreams, and I am just going to do the bare minimum to survive. I feel like a drone. And honestly like there's not much of a reason to live anymore, and that makes me so disappointed in myself because I made so much mental health progress after I started my new job. The thought that my loved ones aren't enough to want to keep going makes me hate myself. It's very selfish of me to want to escape it all without a care of what they would feel. I'm ashamed to say that I think about ways I could kill myself multiple times a day. I keep telling myself to keep going, not for me, but for future me. Because, somewhere, there's a ""me"" that wants to be alive, wants to pursue music, teach kids voice lessons, have a community garden, help people. I just can't wake that ""me"" up.",bropill,1595199053,Yummyfood123,10,7,True,2020-07-19

Don’t know if this is normal or healthy for my emotions.,"Hey bros, as the tittle says I am not so sure if this is normal or not.
The problem at hand is that i really don’t really get that emotional or even sad in the regard when I hear that somebody died.
When I hear about the death of someone famous or even sometimes some people I know, and sometimes far family that they  died the only “emotion” if u can call it ,is the little shock when I hear it and in my mind I just say like “Wow he’s really dead ?” In a questioning manner.
Now these aren’t people that I spent that much time or even if we spent time  in my early years we then drifted apart, I just feel that it’s not healthy and even a little cold that I am just really not experiencing some kind of longer shock or some emotion like sadness or anger.
Fortunately I never had people close to me die , and I wish that the situation stays like this for a long time , but sometimes I question my self if someone close to me dies is that all that I will do the “Guess they’re dead now “ and nothing else.
I still experience emotion like anger.
But sometimes I have this kind of “depressive episodes” if u can call it since I was never checked out for any mental conditions and I don’t wanna throw the word depression loosely, and in this episodes sure I feel sad sometimes but that is toward myself since I have some insecurities and when somedays it gets really bad ,even the trust issues that I had in the past and that they still linger today from time to time get really strong.
So I am concerned in a way that I can’t feel sadness towards another person , as I said there are people that I love and am really close that I would take a bullet for them but if they died would I even feel sad or anger or just go “Nothing you can do life goes on”.

The Girl I was seeing Cut Things Off With Me And I Don't Know How To Feel,"Hello, everyone. I hope all is well with you.

This girl I was seeing for about a month cut things off with me because she felt that we were going too fast and that I liked her way more than she liked me. Although she presented this unfortunate news to me in person (which I commend her for, given the precautions women take to be feel and be safe), I am still reeling in the emotions from that day. What worries me is that the catalyst for her decision may have been me telling her about my depression and anxiety; two things I think she should be aware of before going further. I am now going through a bout of severe depression and don't have much energy to do anything. I hope that in my future romantic encounters aren't suspended due to my openness about my depression and anxiety. I'm not a boogey man.

We all go home. Since this shit is never gonna end, I decide to withdraw for a year. All this time I have a therapist, who I see over zoom. My mindset was “hey, I’m gonna be dropping less acid, but at least I can focus on improving my mental health.” Nope. My therapist tells me today that she’s gonna have to discontinue sessions because of my withdrawal (she’s a school therapist.) She said she’ll email the school to see if they’re gonna let her continue sessions, but given our current near-bankruptcy and economic collapse, doesn’t seem likely imo.

just a stream-of-consciousness thoughtdump,"hey bros, first i want to say how much i love this community; as a long-time lurker, your positivity and genuine caring attitude blows me away, and i just need to write this down somewhere; it isnt everything, but its all that came to mind in my inebriated state (yea, sorry for any errors, im posting this drunk because i know i wouldnt have the confidence sober, i did my best to clean it up) and this community feels like the right place. i dont even know what i want out of it, i dont mean to complain, but its hard to talk about these things with people i know in person. so anyway, here is the flow-of-consciousness thoughtdump of the century:

i have been struggling with alcohol dependency since i was 17, wich scares me because my family has a history of addiction. iv been smoking cigaretes since i was 18, i have done much harder drugs but luckily was able to avoid becoming addicted, i have struggled with self-harm and have attempted suicide once and still struggle with almost daily suicidal thougts. i was an accident and had a very tumoltuous childhood, the highlight was when i spent a year of my life in an abusive religeous cult under the guise of a halfway-house, i was torn away from all my childhood friends on multiple occasions because my parents couldnt afford a perminant home -- so i was dragged all across colorado during my formative years. i have been bullied. im a high-school super-senoir because i didnt graduate, i have never been in a romantic relationship despite knowing other people are interested in me because i ruined it in one way or another, i ruined my relationship with two friend-groups and multiple best friends, i cant afford to see my therapist anymore, i feel like i will never amount to my dreams or be the person i want to be; i feel like i will never amount to the life my father had. i am extrimely awkward and never know how to act in social situations, i feel like i have already ruined my brain by doing too many drugs at such a young age, i am constantly anxious about geopolitics and politics in general and face constant existential dread, i can hardly remember a time when i wasnt depressed, i have made lots of shitty descisions and i am a terrible role-model for my younger siblings, which might just be the number-one thing that makes me feel like a piece of shit. i almost never shower or brush my teeth, i have extreme jelousy issues, i hate the thoughts i have rattling around in my head, my parents have a very tense relationship and i have had to be the adult for my two younger siblings on quite a few occasions. i was preyed on by an extriemely narcisistc person for three years. i want to be a better person, and i try to be the best version of myself i can be, but i always fall short or fall all the way back down. i want to be a scientist, but i will never be able to afford college, and i want to be an artist (i do graffiti, poetry, music, drawings and stories) but i dont feel like i am good enough, i have avoidant restrictive food intake disorder wich haunts me daily and i have been dangerously underweight my whole life. and i waste most of my life when im not at work browsing social media [including reddit] or watching youtube) and i am stuck in what some would consider a dead end job; i have opportunities, but it just feels wrong in some deep, existential way. i just want to experince the best life has to offer, but i realise that probably isnt feasible for me. i have been struggling with religion my entire life; being told by your own mother that you are going to hell isnt easy, and i have ptsd from an extriemely terrefying marijuana experience. i mean, i dont even enjoy video games anymore, i hardly feel any passion for anything anymore besides the rare ""tortured artist"" bout of inspiration. and i still struggle with my sexuality, i am fairly certain i am heterosexual, but i feel homoromantic a lot of the time, wich has lead to a few awkward relationships. and sometimes i even feel asexual and/or demisexual... i dont know, i dont want to discount amybody elses sexuality, but, bottom line: i am still stuck in the hurricane of figuring myself out

not to even mention how stressed out i am about the current global climate; i am an essential worker (residential plumber), and still go to work every week day. i still cannot even fathom how there are people who are so selfish as to dispute the safety protocols in place. the riots have really hit home with me, and i have been doing my best to show solidarity with any group that still experiences institutional discrimination. not to mention the struggle in hong kong. and all of the corrupt politics in the united states... and i could go on-and-on for hours, but the bottom line is that i have been extriemely stressed over all of these issues that have ""recently"" came to light

my general nightly routine is to get home from work, take a 4-hour long nap, wake up, hang out with my siblings as much as i can and then drink and smoke myself to sleep while listening to music. while occasionaly throwing big parties just to remind myself i have friends or hanging out with people on the rare occasion i am actually invited to do anything by any of my friends. i have tried playing dungeons and dragons with an entierly new friend group but i still feel out of place.

and the worst part is i have so many friends and family who care about me deeply and just want whats best for me and are even proud of me, even though i feel like i am not good enough for them, especially because most of them have been through much more in their lives than i have. i have also had so many opportunities to turn my life around and i always squander them in one way or another. and i am fully cognisent of the fact that i lead a better life than like, 80% of the human population, wich make me feel so fucking guilty. plus i have an image of being an extriemely positive, intelligent, social, empathetic and friendly person, wich just makes me even more guilty for being who i really am.

so yea, sorry for the thoughtdump, i dont even care if nobody responds, even just writing this was therapeoudic. but i dont even know what im asking for, the last thing i want to do is be negative, but i have been bottling up my entire life. if you even read this entire clusterfuck, thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

plus, one of my childhood heroes just died, rest in peace, grant imahara, you were a vital part of my childhood, i am not ashamed that you were the first celebriry death i cried over. my heart goes out to everybody you touched in the same way you touched me, and especially to your friends and family. know i lit up a lucky smoke and poured out a beer for you, it was the most i could do",bropill,1595488618,Simoniousc,3,1,True,2020-07-23

I need to get my thoughts out on a 6 month old relationship's end (and friendship potentially ending) (admission of unbro like behavior),"So I did one of these before on general demeanor but I kinda need to do another for general thoughts on my first relationship.

So it kinda all started junior year of highschool (20 right now by the way so 16 then).  I had just failed my first ever class (this is relevant I swear).  And at that point I kinda went off the deep end a bit.  Up uh until then school was easy.  I had built my persona off of being the smartest boy in the room (whether that was true was irrelevant).  Point is that my identity had taken a bit of a hit and my confidence took a massive one.

Fast forward about half a year and my anxiety was kinda getting to me.  I was getting depressed and the only thing getting me out of bed at the time was a friend of mine.  For the sake of anonymity, we'll call her Becky.  Becky and I had known each other since middle school but we'd only really known each other  for about 2 years in 10th grade history (we had the same class). So at first I didnt really know how to talk to girls so I kinda made fun of her, I had the maturity of a slightly arrogant 4th grade at the time.  Me and her would fire back and forth and despite my best efforts we became friends in 10th grade. In all honesty we became friends when I caught her at the time boyfriend in think tell her straight up not to be friends with me after a tutoring session because he hated me (that's a story that I dont really know the details too.  Apparently I reminded him of a kid who bullied him and to be honest I was a nice guy creeper to a girl we were both friends with (THIS WILL BE IMPORTANT LATER (ALSO NOT BECKY))).  I'd like to think I'm not anymore, that I did improve myself these last 4 years but that's really for other people to decide.

Back to 12th grade she started becoming one of my best friends.  At a certain time she became the person I looked forward most to seeing and possibly the only reason I got out of bed in the morning.  It wasn't romantic but I liked being around her and got actively sad when she wasn't there.  Anyway we become best friends and we end up going to the same community college.  Seeing as we didnt really know anyone there (apparently her friend group was flaky and backstab happy while mine just kinda evaporated), we stuck together (althougth I tried to make sure I saw her as much as possible.  I made an active effort is what I'm saying.)

After about a year of being around each other in community college and our friendship rapidly progressing (she's the first person whose house I went over to), she worked up the courage to ask me out.  I was a coward who couldn't tell girls my feelings (as evidenced by me being a nice guy creeper to that one girl), so this was kinda a relief for me.  I never had a girlfriend before (see highschool), and the best previous romantic relationship I had was a girl I met at a food truck who I had my first kiss with (I was 18 at the time) who I never saw again.  

I didn't really see her before hand as a potential romantic partner (Sort of, I was a dick but didn't want to be and I didnt want to ruin our friendship) but we decided to give it a shot (albeit I didnt really think we were dating for at least two weeks until she said she wanted to take boyfriend/girlfriend selfies).

At that point I kinda just did what any kid who lucked his way into a kind, caring person who somehow gave a shit about him, despite all evidence she had to not to, I did my best to prove I was worthy for lack of a better word.  I tried to be the best boyfriend i could. 

We went out, we did things and for a good while I was happy.  I found an adventuring partner and she was right in front of me the whole time.  A d against all odds I started to be a better person.  I gave more of a shit about my appearance, I ate better, i exercised more, I studied more.  Throught the power of ""Holy Shit someone likes me and I like them and they dont hate me!  Is this love!?!"" I became a better person.  I opened myself up to her in a way I never done with anyone before.  She saw a vulnerable side of me and I let her know everything about me.  My deep seated issues of loneliness, my years of being friendless up until middle school, my inadequacy issues, my at the time ""confusion?"", ""questioning?"" of my sexuality and gender (came out the same way by the end but it was nice to be able to tell someone not my parents about it).  Basically she could read me like a book and semi vice versa.  And even after being the most vulnerable i had ever been, she made me, a cripplingly insecure teenage boy man feel like he was bulletproof.  Like I could fly.  We even told each other we loved each other while I was at the gym of all places.  It felt natural and right.

Now at that point (and looking back) I could kinda see the cracks.  While we had a strong relationship, It wasn't without foible.  She had some issues.  Her family wasn't stable and her mom was sick.  She needed a job to bring in income to help and was basically a mini parent for her little siblings.  We had trouble really being intimate as we were always at her house and if we werent we were at school.  Even past that we couldn't pull it off.  So she gave me and out.  And I didnt take it.  She felt she had too much baggage.  I, not realizing if a girl gives you an out, it means she wants out, said no, confident in whatever issues we had we could work them out.

At some point in October she told me about her depression, saying if I wanted to stay in, I'd have to deal with it and that no matter what I did I wouldnt be able to help her, she wouldn't be the most emotional available partner.  She gave me and out again and I still didnt take it.

At that point our relationship was actually pretty good outs withstanding. We went to the beach where I swear she looked at my like I was the best thing since sliced bread and we did an escape room where she promised to get over her fear of handcuffs (she didnt).  Until December 21st, 2019.

We went over to a friends house for a game of Smash and Cards against humanity and the subject of past relationships came up.  Like I said I never really had one before hand past a fling in summer of 18, so I talked about that girl I was a nice guy too.  How I regretted doing that to her, how she gave me a chance but i was too much of a dick or a coward to actually try.  But at the end of the night she gave me my final out and I once again said no.  She talked to me on how she didnt really feel anything.  She was kinda numb.  And she was worried she didnt feel anything between us. And she was worried that I was only going out with her because I didnt get with the other girl.  I told her that what I felt toward the other girl was unhealthy (it was), that I was passed it and only reason I would ever want to meet her again was to say sorry about being a dick.  Eventually the night came to an end.

That wasn't our first issue (second).  The first was a dinner at Texas Road House where I was uncomfortable with her calling me her future husband (I saw a massive red flag).  We talked about it and she said that her past boyfriends where clingy and where comforted by shit like that.  I really wasn't. I was only 20 and we both agreed we didnt really want that.  We started discussing how our relationship would hypothetically end (she said she would drive me away, I said I would mess up by cheating on her or something).  Kids never tell a girl that you'd probably end the relationship by cheating on her somehow.  You might mean it as a self deprivation joke but it never results in a net positive

But back to the point she steered clear of me for a few days until the 23rd where she told me we needed to talk but later.  And on the 24th after an existential crisis about not having any friends and then getting my 3 friends back and feeling that I was going to pull Christams eve off, I called her. And she broke up with me.  It's never good to have your heart broken kids. Its really not good to have it broken Christmas Eve.  It was my fault, she wanted to wait until after Christmas to tell me and I forced the issue.  She told me she loved me but she didnt love me like that.  That the love wasn't instant, there wasn't that spark.

I reacted fairly well in my opinion.  No cursing, no resentment, just kinda crying and talking and joking in the back of my moms car for an hour.

I saw her again the next day as I was going to give her her gift and had to go into work (got broken up with and had to work (worst Christmas I think I ever experienced ngl)).  We talked a bit and tried to work some shit out.  At that point I was still processing and we just kinda talked.  And I went to work.  One shift with cookies she made me in a Santa container, and cry singing Queen's ""Death on two legs"" is how I ended the night.  It wasn't until Januray 4th I think that I saw her again. 

We wanted to meet up earlier but she canceled and rescheduled.  After seeing a movie we went to the parking lot.  She caught me up on her life and how she was feeling better.  Lived life a bit more fully.  And I broke down.  I tried to keep it in but at that point I just kinda broke.  I didnt really have many friends and kinda became distant to the ones I did have, so she was all I had.  I know it was unfair but I told her I was scared to be alone.  How I was scared if it was something I did or if i messed up.  She reassured me it wasn't and she was only really glad i didn't hate her.  She comforted me and we eventually agreed we were going to be friends till the end, damn normal dating/break up conventions.  And I was happy, because I really didnt want to be alone.

Fast forward a bit and she got me a job at her fast food place.  I took the job because I wanted to spend more time with my friend, although in hindsight it might have been a massive mistake.  She coached me a bit and our relationship eventually became big sister/little brother.  It took me until after Valentine's day to kinda accept it.

As the months went on I thought we developed a good rapport.  It was until I told her I was leaving come Fall.  I was in a program that would let me transfer to another school. I wanted us to kinda fuck around in the summer.  Two friends against the world.  A last hoorah.  Needless to say the program blew up in my face and I never left.  And then the Virus hit.  

After taking 2 weeks of off time it was back to work.  And if I wasn't a good employee before I wasn't one then.  I got too close to costumers and treated them curtly, apparently.  I didnt really give a shit about the job.  Not really.  I took it for the money and to spend time with Becky but that didnt really pan out and I think that led to some issues I hadn't considered.  Becky needed her job and if I wasn't good there I reflected badly on her.  So I tried.  I tried my best.  Not for my own sake or for caring about the job but for her.  So she wouldnt be disappointed in me.  Needless to say I know the issues with that now.

She eventually called me and tried to push me toward other employment.  And I told her about the program blowing up in my face.  She worried about me in the way that big sisters do.  I think she was worried but I kinda just said I'd deal.  It roll off my back.  After all I was bullet proof.  (Not just a metaphor for how she made me feel, I kinda turned it into a catchphrase).

Eventually I got my foot ran over by a customer.  And left work for a week.  She texted me or i texted her about something stupid and that was that.  Eventually they let me go and I think that was for the best.  I wasn't the best employee and it was a stressful time.  They didnt need a laibility.  

I tried texting her again(few times actually) but she didnt really respond.  I dont think she's picking up again.  I don't know if she doesn't want to talk to me any more or if things have just been too busy with
Covid and trying to keep her family afloat.  Either way it's been a while. And maybe its just paranoia and my perpetual fear of loneliness, but I think she's gone.


I dont know why I wrote this down.  Maybe to chronical my first relationship, maybe pity points.  As a reminder to be better, I dont know.

To sum up some thoughts, I miss her.  I loved her and I miss our relationship, friendship or romantic.  Looking back I missed a lot of red flags but I was so over joyed at someone liking me I couldn't see them.

I think maybe I should have stayed clear of her for a month at least but like I said, loneliness and abandonment and not having a wide support circle is a bitch.

Honestly end of the day, I'm just worried I let her down.  She believed in me, trusted me and I let her down.

(Tell me if theres any problematic behavior here, I dont know.  Bad framing or just a refusal to let go).

Any way, see ya and to the Future guess.",bropill,1593411593,MiracleAlien,1,1,True,2020-06-28
Time for a vent,"I don't really want this upvoted, I just want to get my feelings off my chest since I don't have a social media space to do it anymore. I just discovered this sub and figure that it seems the right kind of community to relate to.

Man, I've been single 5 years since May. I've barely touched a girl apart from a couple of dates with someone a year or so ago. I think at this point I've resigned myself to accept that that number of years is just going to keep rising.

None of my romantic relationships have ever been fulfilling - each one I think had been me going along with the motions. I would forever be insecure that I could be doing better or that it wasn't really me. Majority of breakups I've been a right dick through. I feel to an extent I self sabotaged most of them.

I think, if I really tried, I could have ended this 5 year streak earlier but I self sabotage every opportunity that has potential. I think I feel like I don't deserve it but also I think I'm terrified of either bringing negativity to someone else or just change to my life balance. I'm not sure.

Bros, I just want to meet someone who makes me happy but at the moment I don't meet anyone new. Dating apps don't work, I can't converse on online chat for shit. The only way I can see of getting out of this mess is meeting someone naturally that I genuinely get on with but I'm at a complete loss on how I find that place in my mid twenties.

I don't think I could ever bring myself to speak to a friend about all of this and unpick the last 10 years of my life, I wish I could afford counselling to figure this all out.

Lady friend here! Wanted to share a great tool I found for opening up with people,"Hey there, bros. I am a lady friend who also happens to be a reverend. I recently came across a good tool to help bros open up to people on the regular that you might find helpful.

The tool is called TableTopics. $15-$20 US on Amazon.

It's basically a cube full of little cardboard questions. They can be themed or not. But they're all open ended and designed to promote discussion.

Buy one of these, keep in in your living room, bedroom, office, whatever. And once a week, pop a few out and ask the people around you. It'll be weird like once. After that, they'll know you as the Person With The Question Cube and it'll just be a fun thing.

I've seen great results from bros in particular because it's a great way to practice opening up. Even if the question is something like, ""Who would you cast in a movie to play you?"", it's fun to think about your answer and gain insight into other people's answers.",bropill,1593490985,MarbleMimic,3,1,True,2020-06-29
"Hey bros, I was a bad boyfriend and I can't move on","Hey bros, sorry if its a bit long.

&amp;#x200B;

I completely ruined my most recent relationship, and I've spent the last 7 months really regretting it. We were together 2 years (with a break). I didn't commit to the relationship enough and I always had one foot out the door. This made her feel insecure about our relationship and it hurt her. I hate it, I didn't realize at the time but I've been pretty seriously affected by previous experiences. My first ever girlfriend - who I genuinely believed I wanted to spend my entire life with (we were 16) - left me for a dude she met on a holiday, she even said she wished she'd cheated on me. I was destroyed -  just crying into my breakfast every morning before school for like 15 minutes a time lol. My second girlfriend was really horrible to me at times, often she used to tell me what I could and couldn't do and would give me ultimatums about us breaking up if I didn't listen to her. (I don't say this as if I'm an angel - but my behaviors were nothing like that). Also my dad - who I don't have anything to do with now - threatened to abandon me when I was a kid sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I've got walls that are high af and somewhat impenetrable. And this didn't stop my most recent ex from trying, and I fucked it up. I wasn't acknowledging that I was behaving in a selfish way to keep myself safe. It's only been after the breakup that I've realized I had turned into a toxic person. I've been to therapy a little and will start again as soon as it's allowed in the lockdown. But the pain just isn't getting better. I can't talk to her about it because that would be selfish, she's happy and with someone new and it's not her job to make me feel better about myself. (We're still on talking terms every once in a while which is nice - I have apologized to her sincerely once before she was serious with this guy, but I didn't go in depth about my struggles or the therapy or anything because I didnt think that would be fair to her). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so much more aware now and determined to be a better person but I'm scared. I'm scared that if I let her go and start to feel a little better about myself and my future I'll just forget all about my vulnerabilities and let my ego take over again. I don't want to devolve back into a POS, and right now the pain of losing her keeps me centered on not being a bad person. What if I let her go, start trying to meet new people and just fall back into bad habits?",bropill,1593511605,koorbes,7,1,True,2020-06-30
Lost my mind last week,"In this story I'm definitely the bad guy. But I need to confess it... need to own it.

As the warm weather rolls in work is heating up along with it. At first I was just spending less time in the store and more time installing hitches, but soon I was walking in to a waiting car or truck ready to be worked on and a full day of appointments. 

But now it's nuts. The installation schedule is backed way up, and the kids working the front desk are just jamming appointments in wherever they can. This means that they're giving me a half hour to do 2 hours of work, and I've got appointments like that stacked back to back all day.

But this doesn't stop them from asking me every 30 minutes how much longer I'm going to be. 

Two weeks of this has left me wrecked inside and out. I'm covered in fresh cuts and bruises, filled with strained and swollen muscles, and my hands just ache. And the heat... hours and hours of hard labor in this goddamn heat under massive pressure...

I've complained. Everyone kind of acts like they've heard me. My manager, S., is doing her best. But they have a dozen other things to do and problems of their own, so I'm not getting their full attention. 

Monday rolls around and, after sleeping through most of my weekend, I brace myself as I pull up what's on deck.

It's full. One short of my record for the most cars I've ever done in a day. But if things go well I should make it home in time to shower and go to my meditation class... so I've got that to look forward to.

I do a little complaining at the desk staff and then get to work. 

And everything goes wrong. Rusty cars fighting me every step of the way, orders with the wrong parts on them, instructions that are just plain dead wrong for hitch and wiring work, panels that decide they won't go back into place...etc... you name it, the world hates me.

And damn is it hot. I'm putting in the kind of effort people do for an intense gym workout, but for over 8 hours, without a break, in a goddamn oven.

In addition to my aching body, my head begins to throb. Heat stroke? Dehydration? Maybe it's the fact that I can't even stop to eat anything today?

I'm an hour past the end of my shift when I drag myself into the office with the keys and paperwork from the last car... and I see that another one is waiting.

They snuck in another car.

I explode. S is dealing with a customer at the time. I don't care. I lose my mind. I start swearing, yelling, saying ""what the fk do you people expect from me,"" and ""I don't suck, let's make that clear! It's not my fault things are behind,"" and ""Im breaking down here! I don't know how much more I can take,"" and... oh who knows what else. I go full-on angry and aggressive rant, aiming it all right at S.

The other girl working at the time excuses herself. S tries to appease me with solutions. I don't believe her. It's not like she wasn't told before. She's bs'ing me, I'm sure of it.

Finally I grab the remaining clipboard and issue a parting threat: ""I'm going to do this, but if things don't change I'm just going to have to start walking out on jobs!""

Ironically the last job of the day only takes half as long as expected. But despite this I clock out in a bitter huff with a few more choice words, my brain absolutely pounding in my skull, drenched in the last of my body's fluids, and go home knowing there's no possible way I can make that meditation class I wanted to go to.

So I take a cold shower, drink a gallon of water, eat, and go straight to bed. 

I sleep about 10 hours.

And in the morning I realize what I've done.

I yelled at S, my manager; the woman who has had my back a dozen times over, who works hard as hell to keep this ship afloat despite the idiocy from upper management, who has a dozen priorities all competing for top priority. 

She's never cruel, always compassionate, and cares for the younger boys working in the shop like they were her own kids.

And I attacked her.

Oh I had reasons. Sure I did. Some might even say it was ""understandable under the circumstances"".

But screw all that. I allowed life to pressure me into hurting someone. That's a critical failure. Period. 

So when she comes in, after she gets settled and has the time, I apologize. And after she acknowledges it, I apologize again, this time in much more detail for exactly what I'm sorry about. She admits that it had really distressed her and that she almost walked out that day. I listen. I tell her it will never happen again and I'll do my best from here. 

And we get along for the rest of the day... but honestly that just makes it worse. So in the afternoon as she passes by i stop the job I'm working on and apologize again for my poor behavior, but also express regret for the hurt I caused her personally.

And then I apologize to the other girl that had to witness my little tantrum. 

But none of that means anything if I ever behave that way again. 

Now, everyone was been great for the rest of the week at looking out for me and keeping the schedule reasonable, and I've actually been able to leave on time almost every day... but the real test comes when things go to hell again. 

And they will, eventually. Things happen. So I've got to be ready. 

I don't know how to be sure about that... at least not yet... but any suggestions will be welcome.",bropill,1593597449,Ohigetjokes,10,1,True,2020-07-01

Bro hugs are Ok,"I've been working in this company for nearly the past two years and yesterday was my last day. So as I'm cleaning out my desk, one of my work friends, Abel, passed by my desk to say goodbye. 

He told me that I look sad and asked what was wrong. I jokingly respond, ""It's just that I'm going to miss you so much"" while pretend crying. Then Abel jokingly asks, ""Do you want a hug?"" This whole exchange was just a joke between the two of us but a female coworker happened to be walking by and heard the conversation. She decided to make it known to us that she thought two guys hugging was weird and we shouldn't do it, then she proceeded to walk towards the door. 

Abel and I looked at each other and both ran ahead of her to block the door. We then hugged each other right in front of her, in full view of everyone in the office. It was one of those hugs that goes on way too long as well. After we were done, we then let her leave. 

It was our way of showing her and everyone watching that two men hugging is OK. We should normalize bro hugs.",bropill,1593642875,boatoa,11,1,True,2020-07-01
I'm stuck. I hate my life. I need help.," Okay, so today I'm feeling the worst I've felt in a long, long time. So I'm going to write this out and maybe ask for help. I'm gonna spill my fucking guts right now, so be prepared for godlike levels of TMI.    

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 25. I'm a virgin. I've only been in one relationship and I broke up with her because I wasn't attracted to her. I handled it ungracefuly and hurt her, a lot. That was when I was 19. I'm trans, 5'2”, and chubby. I've been on hormones just long enough to have a smattering of sex characteristics that is almost perfectly half way between male and female, and effect which is unsettling to look at let alone live in. I look like a 16 year old boy on my best days. I'm not attractive in literally any respect.  

&amp;#x200B;

 I dropped out of school when I was 18, a few months before the end of my final year, because I couldn't handle the pressure. I've attempted and failed 2 university degrees since then, because of the same reasons. I still live at home with my mother, despite wanting to move out for years. I live in a tiny bedroom that is currently in a state of squalor due to my own low standards and a lack of energy.   

&amp;#x200B;

 I've never lasted at any job for more than a few weeks. My most recent attempt at employment is in the process of ending because I haven't been able to work at all in the past few months due to an ongoing illness. Working in the food industry while ill during a pandemic is just a level of irresponsibility even I refuse to stoop to. Not to mention I had an hour long panic attack halfway during my third shift, so that was probably never going to last anyway. I have never held down a job. I have no career. No reliable references and no path to employment that I can see beyond literally walking the street and sucking dicks for money. I can't even get hired to scrub toilets.   

&amp;#x200B;

I have two friends in the world, and I haven't spoken to either of them in months, because they both have lives and I don't want to get in their way. Plus, my social skills are totally underdeveloped and crawling back to stunted conversations and endless rounds of small talk with people I used to share my soul with is just too painful. I know that game, I've done it before and it never goes anywhere. Same goes for my wider family, none of which even acknowledge my gender even if they're accepting of me at all.   

&amp;#x200B;

  
 I'm a failure and a fuck up. Outside of my immediate family and a few former friends, no one in the world would care if I didn't wake up tomorrow. That is not suicidal ideation, it's a statement of fact. I've been in some form of therapy for half a decade, but functionally, my life is identical to when I was a teenager. I have some tools for combating panic attacks and recognising mental distortions, and I have a better idea of why I feel this way. But knowing why doesn't solve that why and it doesn't change the fact that objectively I am far, far behind most people my age. Inadequacy and shame haunt me every single day. Some days are better than others only because some days I'm better at ignoring how objectively shitty my life is.     
 

&amp;#x200B;

 Years of therapy have finally gotten me to a point where I don't actively hate myself any more. I'm not a bad person, I'm not a monster, or a mistake. I'm kind and compassionate and intelligent and creative. I suffer from anxiety and depression and I take my meds. My immune system is in decline and my health is failing. These are reasons and excuses. It doesn't change the fact that there is nothing in me that could not be found a thousand times elsewhere. The fact that there is nothing in my life to be proud of. Nothing that anyone with any self respect would want to be a part of.    
  

Before the pandemic, I was volunteering at a LGBTQ+ mental health help line and attending a weekly choir. But even before I was brought low by my body fucking itself over my involvement those things had begun to dwindle under the weight of my own anxiety and energy levels.    

&amp;#x200B;

  
  I want my own place. I want a job that I don't loathe every second of. I want to date and not have to worry that my potential partner sees me as less of a man because I don't have a dick, or I look like a child, or I have literally no experience with adult relationships. I just want to be a regular 25 year old guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's nothing holding me back that doesn't hold back hundreds of thousands of healthy, successful, fulfilled people every single day. And even if I were to make a start on changing my life it wouldn't change the fact that I'm halfway through my twenties and starting from a place most people leave when they're teenagers. I feel like I'm stuck in this hole, that I have been for years, and despite running around in circles all I can manage, I still see no way out and have only dug myself deeper. I need help, but I have no idea where to look or how to ask for it or even if I'd be able make use of it. I just.... I need help. Please.",bropill,1593675290,StarBurningCold,18,1,True,2020-07-02

Be cool with each other (long read),"I’m just going to say this and I hope I don’t make anybody mad. There was a post talking to specifically women here about how they should take care about their mental health too. I saw many comments that were positive and supportive. Positive comments were also inclusive to non-binary individuals and men as well, encouraging them to also take care of themselves. Great messages all around! 

But then I saw negativity where some comments were like “WELL MEN COMMIT SUCIDE MORE. WE SHOULD FOCUS MORE OM THEM.WHY DO WOMEN NEED A POST? ”. These comments were not like the positive comments that were inclusive. No these comments were a competition of “men vs women” and who has it worse. 

I just wanted to say that just because a poster is saying women’s emotional health matters, doesn’t mean they are saying that men’s emotional health doesn’t matter. We are not downplaying what men go through at all. If a post is specifically talking to women, that doesn’t mean we hate men. This is not a competition. Bringing up men’s issues “MEN HAVE IT WORSE” every time a woman talks about women’s mental health can come across as patronizing and vise versa. For example, if a post that tried to focus on male depression had comments like “BUT WOMEN ATTEMPT IT MORE”, it would come across as patronizing too. Context matters a lot guys. Yes, male suicide rates are higher. Nobody is arguing that . But it should be okay to bring up female facts on depression in a post that specifically targets women without people getting upset and having that “us vs them” mentality”. 

If this post was specifically about men’s mental health, I would only comment about men’s mental health statistics because they deserve the time of day to be focused on with their own post. Same thing with women’s mental health. They also deserve to be focused on with their own post and comments with female health facts on depression without people bringing up “MALE SUICDE RATES ARE HIGHER” every damn time. These people aren’t trying to be inclusive. They’re trying to start a mini gender war. Tone matters guys. 

If this post mentioned everybody it would be one thing to bring up “men die more” so it can be an open discussion, but when a post is specifically targeting the female demographic and trying to lift them up, and then we see comments like  “WHY DO WOMEN NEED A POST? MEN HAVE IT WORSE” it becomes very discouraging for us. Your reasoning for bringing that fact up is not to open a dialogue, but is instead is a means to disregard a woman’s experiences as “not as bad” when the original post was just trying to encourage women to get help. It’s not cool to do this. Listen, we all have problems. It’s good to talk about them and if a post wants to focus on a certain demographic and give them some positivity, don’t flip the fuck out and start trying to make it a competition. Be bros. Love and empathy is what we all need. And women, do the same for our fellow man when it’s their time to talk as well. 

______________________________________________________________________________
TLTR: If a post targets a certain demographic please don’t flip out and make it a “us vs them” thing of who has it worse. Stop trying to take the attention off of what the specific post is actually about because it doesn’t meet your agenda Just because somebody may have it worse, does not mean we shouldn’t talk about a certain problem a specific demographic faces. .

"She left, and I'm broken. What next?","Well, it happened. She left. Things have been rocky for a long time, but I still love her with everything I am. She pointed out all of the things I've done that hurt her, especially the times I broke her trust. I apologized, agreed to go to therapy, to do anything she needed to heal. It wasn't enough.

She said she still loves me and wants to keep me in her life. I want her in my life too. We agreed to be friends for now, which I'm trying to be okay with. I can barely imagine a life without kissing her every day - I won't accept a life without her in it. I couldn't ever tell her this because I don't want to manipulate her (she deserves better than that) but I'm planning to buy a gun. Maybe. I don't know yet. I just can't imagine being able to cope with this. She said that she would consider trying again if I can fix my problems, but we need to cross that bridge when we come to it. I don't know what to do with that. I kept telling her not to give me false hope and to let me move on and heal if she doesn't want me anymore,  but the thought of her with someone else breaks me. She takes a long time between relationships (6 months to 2 years) so I know I have at least a little while to try and rebuild our trust before she would start dating again. I just don't know where to go from here. We've both hurt each other so badly, but I want her back. When I think of my future, she's the one I'm with forever. The breakup hasn't changed that. She's still the love of my life, and my best friend.

So, now that a lot of terf and alt-right subs have been banned, and the itsafetish sub, the most vile place I have ever seen, has gone private, I can admit this. So, I am a trans girl who has a porn addiction. I discovered my gender identity through it when I first watched sissy porn. If you’re OOTL, sissy porn is a fetish where  guys are forced to cross dress and have sex with men. When I first discovered it, it forced me to re examine my gender and sexuality, but I feel like it pushed me more and more into liking men. When I was a kid, I had  a desire to be a gay woman. Now, after going through all this, and being on HRT for six months tomorrow, I feel like my sexuality has been thrown on its head. I’m currently identifying as asexual, but that may change.

Me and my working colleague figured out the perfect comeback to our work place's toxic environment!,"Hi all! I just want to tell (with my bad english) a story from last week, maybe this is helpful to someone. 

I'm an uni student and I have a part time job in blue collar work. I like the work but our work place consist only of very masculine behaviour middle aged white men and sometimes their behaviour just annoys me. They seem to look down on every one who is younger, female, different color etc. The workplace has two part timers, me and this young girl. The full timers are having a habit of picking on me of being acadamic and her of being a girl, but this week me and her figured out the perfect comeback to how to shut them up: being genuinely nice. We were together in a store with the girl, we noticed a good discount to a big ice cream and decided to buy everyone an icecream at work. It was just beautiful.

I'm finally beginning to feel comfortable and confident in my own body.,"Hey bros, it's been a while. I really wanted to tell someone this but I didn't know who to go to so I decided to come here.

Ever since I was a kid I've had major body issues. When I was little I was always slightly chubby, no matter how hard I tried to not be. I'd constantly go out and be active but it never really did much, and that has progressed into adulthood.

I'm still the same slightly chubby genderflubro, and tackling mental illness knowing that has made it much harder. But today I've finally began to make progress.

I still live with my family, and my parents decided to go and do some shopping for clothes as lockdowns easing in my area. I didn't go (multiple reasons why, and after they returned they told me they were glad I didn't as it was a perfect panic attack setup) so everything they got for me was a complete surprise. And a surprise that was very welcome.

I'm now sat in a blue hoodie and grey leggings, and I actually feel confident about my look. Sure I may not be beauty model standard, but I'm definitely not extremely unhealthy or at risk. I'm in the middle, and I'm pretty happy with that.

To all my bros, fembros and any bros in between, I hope you feel good about yourself today. It's difficult and can sometimes weigh you down, but you're beautiful. Everyone is. And I hope you have a good day.",bropill,1593971051,DrRobertBanner,4,3,True,2020-07-05

My nephew was there for me at a very dark time and I'll never forget it,"Just discovered this sub and I'm excited that I have a place to share this. 

So I'm at work when I get a call that my Uncle R is dying. His body is rejecting the meds that have been keeping him alive, his liver and pancreas are shot, and we're at the point where they're just giving him morphine and waiting for him to die. He's got a few days, maybe a week if he's as stubborn as grandma was.

At the time I don't mention it to anyone and keep working. Things are heating up and I'm busier than ever with double booked cars to work on and chaos in the front office making it hard for me to get through a job without distraction. 

But as the week goes on I find that these cars are harder than usual. The bolts are fighting me more, the parts I'm mounting are heavier, the wiring is unusually  complicated, I'm getting covered in more dirt and grease than usual, etc etc...

And I start getting mad. A little more every day. And I start taking it out on people. And I start swearing loudly while working and not caring who hears it. I mean let's call it what it is: I'm a bit of an ass.

But at the time I just figured... man these cars all suck... it's these stupid cars...

And then the call comes in that my uncle died. 

It's a Wednesday. Sunny, but not too hot. And I look around after the call and wonder why everything seems so quiet. 

This is when my nephew comes through. (We work at the same place.)

""Hey what's up Uncle C?""

""Oh, nothing. Just found out my uncle died.""

""Oh my God! You said that so weirdly casually. Are you okay?""

""Ya, ya it's fine, he's been sick for years now and we've known for a few days that this was going to happen. I'm okay.""

""Well it's okay to be upset. I know if my uncle died I'd be really upset!""

I actually blush when I thank him. He gives me a hug. Like, a good one. And for the first time I'm able to appreciate just how deeply it was bugging me.

But I still come to work the next day like nothing happened. And, well, my nephew calls me out on it:

""Dude I thought you'd take a day off after what happened.""

""Oh, no, I'm okay.""

""Okay well let me know if you need anything.""

Another big hug. He tells me: ""Love you Uncle C"" when he leaves. It moves me.

Ya, no I'm not. I'm not okay.

As the day goes on I think about my uncle. I realize how hard I've worked these past few years not to think about him. I can't stand that he's been stuck in that wheelchair. I can't stand that he's in and out of delirium and doesn't know I'm even there, much less who I am, but instead he's arguing with invisible people or crying or drooling on himself or ... goddamn 

So. This is hard to type. Pressing on

Anyway I realize that Thursday that I've been all kinds of messed up over my uncle for years, but I've been able to avoid my feelings somehow. But now that he's dead I can't. I'm angry and scared and .. stuff.. I'm sorry guys I need to move on from this part but I hope you get the picture..

Anyway I take my nephew's advice and take Friday off. And I needed it. It was a huge pain for everyone at work and made for some awkward situations but I definitely needed to take a day and process stuff.

Over the next couple weeks my nephew keeps checking in with me. He encourages me to share my feelings. He grabs my favorite tea and snack from Tim's. He tells me what's going on in his life. He tells me he loves me every day.

And it helps. It helps so damn much. When I'm lost in an ocean of hurt and can't see any way out he always pops up and helps ground me just by being supportive. 

I start being able to talk about my uncle.

I owe that kid so much. For the rest of my life I'm going to owe him. And I hope, deeply hope, that I can be there for him too in the years to come.

Love you too K.",bropill,1592053576,Ohigetjokes,7,145,True,2020-06-13
"Trans bro here, trying to figure things out","I just wanted to first say that this community seems so awesome and full of kind people. Thank you all for being so cool.

My problem I'm having is sort of complicated. I'm an FGLI (first gen low income) student at an elite university, and I've been struggling with the pressure to succeed and the difficulty with just academics generally. Typical imposter syndrome stuff. But it's made worse because I feel sort of isolated socially too. It's the first time that I've really entered a new social scene without being obviously trans- most people don't catch on now, and that's awesome in a way. But I feel like I'm missing something with navigating social situations. I get weird vibes off of people like I'm not acting the way they expect me to. I've tried joining some men's sports clubs, but I wasn't in a good place physically, and I felt so awkward and out of place that I ended up quiting, which was embarrassing. I've made a few friends, but I feel very alone most of the time, and I don't have that close group of male friends it seems like so many guys thrive off of. I feel like a fake. It hasn't been good for my dysphoria, but I don't know how to fix it. I'd really like to find my people.

Should I stay friends with her?,"Whats up bros, 
so I kinda have a situation rn. There is this girl Ive been friends with for quite some time now, we had a rough patch as friends and recently reconnected. Before our contact break we had a short term FWB thing going on, but only more complicated, (dont wanna go into details) so anyway. Me and her recently reconnected after she and her bf (whom I know) broke up. I always thought they were a great couple and initially wanted to remedy the relationship, but soon realised she just needed to end the relationship. I wasnt expecting much more out of that interaction but she started to hmu almost daily and we got really close again, one evening we both get really drunk playing a drinking game (and I should mention we are long distance friends so we played it over discord) and she tells me she wants to be FWB again. Iam like hell yeah sure, since I started to catch feelings for her again. Okay, so we say we meet up, keep it casual, but a few days after, she is having the worst mood and begins to cry, Iam like woah, whats up. So she tells me how she misses her ex even tho the relationship isnt something she really wants either. So naturally I ask her if she really is sure about this whole FWB thing then. She replies no, and so we call it off. The thing is. Iam still very much in love with this girl, I respect her decision and love her as a friend but even tho Ive told her how I feel about her and got a clear no. I still cant get her out of my head. So the question Iam asking myself is, should I break things off with he? Since I dont want for her to be responsible for my happiness, thats somethin I should be responsible for myself, noone else. I really do love this girl and only want the best for her, but if I saw her with anybody else rn, I wouldnt be able to take it. So what do you guys think? Tell her I need some space and distance myself from her? Or just suck it up and keep an awesome friend while hoping these feelings will fade over time?

I posted on this sub like a month and a half ago, complaining about my life's issues. Just wanted you to know how much you helped me staying positive, and how much I've been improving in the last weeks! 
I started going to therapy more often, I've been trying to stop drinking that much alcohol and I've also started looking at me with much more positivity, trying to understand what my weak sides are and working on that. This means a lot, when you consider that some 4-5 years ago I was almost at incel-tier levels of negativity. 

My advice to everyone is: don't let yourself drown into negativity, don't get frustrated, because that leads to being toxic to people around you and most importantly to yourself. 
Talk to someone, and don't be afraid of showing your emotions, because that's what being strong is all about: feeling secure enough to show how you, as anyone, can sometimes have a difficult time.",bropill,1592095875,Kitri2,0,3,True,2020-06-13

I just cried for the first time in months.,"Hey Bros,

I recently went on a date with a girl where we went to the cinema. The only movie running that late was, weirdly enough, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"". While I didn't always pay attention to the movie, what stuck was that Mr. Rogers was a great person.

So I went on YouTube and started watching a few of his videos and they really made me think about my feelings. His words are just incredibly powerful and true. I think most people, even those who are older, should take a look at his work. He just has the ability to talk about very painful things in a calm and relatable manner.

Love you bros!

Every turn I take makes me feel like I'm being forced back into the corner of suicidal thoughts, like I just can't escape it. I've been to multiple people irl and multiple places here but nothings helped, and I feel like this place could give me a hand.

I feel like I'm just going nowhere in life and the next wrong turn will leave me either dead or drunk in an alleyway with nobody to care about me. Life's hitting me like a ton of bricks, but due to some drama with my sister everyone's more focused on her and I tend to get pushed away. It feels like nobody cares anymore.

My Good Buddy's Daughter is Now His Son,"With everything else going on right now, I'm feeling a little frazzled with life (posted on here a week ago about my 13 y/o cousin).

Anyway, my brother from another mother had a 14 year old daughter that is now his 14 year old son. He came out about a year ago, but my bro hasn't ever shared that with me. I don't think it's shame, just discomfort maybe? Definitely not shame. Maybe allowing the boy to let everyone know on his own terms? 

Anyway, my bro hasn't talked to me about it, but his ex-wife reached out to me to express condolences on my cousin's untimely passing, and told me about her son, and confessed to me  that she's worried about her son, since trans people are so vulnerable to such things. 

I am very worried that 14 years of habit will lead me to accidentally dead-name him, so I plan to talk to him about my fear so that he knows I'm on board 100% and if I do it, it's because I was careless, but not because I don't care.

"Hey bros, me again. Need some breakup support","Hey bros. This past few weeks have been a rollercoaster and I'm still feeling the whiplash. I was in a wonderful relationship since December that ended abruptly in May. We tried to stay cordial because of our shared friend circle but the connection stayed electric and we just couldn't keep away from each other.

Last week she told me she wanted to give it another try. That she'd work on it. That she was tired of running away and tired of overthinking things. And today she broke up with me for the same reason she broke up with me in the first place. The age difference. I'm 23 and she's 27. She doesn't see it working out in the long run and she doesn't want to keep doing this. Nevermind the wonderful times we had and continued to have together. Nevermind that it feels like she barely gave it a chance, and nevermind that she told me that she didn't think anyone could treat her as well as I did. Despite all of that she still doesn't see it working out in the long run.

Is it weird that I have an easier time becoming friends with gals than with guys?,"I think it’s because I’ve never had a female friend make fun of me for anything, while pretty much all of my male friends have actively made fun of me, my insecurities and just things I like. A dude legit once told me that the reason I don’t get girls is because of my appearance. Now I already knew this was true but him saying it didn’t really make me feel better about myself. My appearance just so happens to be one of my many insecurities :) 

I guess this is some sort of rant? About different things that I guess doesn’t really belong together in the same rant.

The beginning of my redemption arc.,"Hey bros, this is going to be an involved post but hopefully rather succinct. I just graduated from college with a degree in Music (piano). It was a shit show. I mean, absolute shit show. I passed classes because of pity from my professors rather than real merit. I didn't earn my degree like I should have, and it's (rightfully) shattered my confidence and self worth. I want to go to grad school in three years, but I have personal development to do. My biggest hurdle is getting past my depression that I have not dealt with healthily for longer than I care to remember. Exercise, healthy diet, therapy, openness, and hard work are going to be my tools for my success. I have a very hard journey ahead of me, and I feel overwhelmed and like I'm too weak to do it frequently. I know in my heart that it's my depression talking, but it's the only voice I hear.

I have a life ahead of me, a good one if I am willing and able to do the work. I'm going to start putting on recitals and giving lessons as well. The thing that I want to do most of all is perform the Rach 3, the infamously hard piano concerto by Rachmaninoff. I'm giving myself three years to learn it. This is my promise to myself and to the bros: I will perform the Rach 3 in some capacity by the time I turn 26. I know that my biggest challenge is going to be working in spite of my depression, but if it wants to stop me from meeting my potential, it can kill me like a real disease. 

This is my quest for redemption, to feel like I really earned my degree, and to prove that I can do grad school. If you're like me and have a past of guilt and regrets (I have more than my fair share), the best thing to do is figure out what it will take for you to forgive yourself and move past it. It's hard, painful work, but it will make you a better person.

"Bros, in this era of social disconnection, I've been using ""the apps"", but they make me feel worthless. Help? How can a bro get some validation that he has worth and value?","It's very hard to meet people these days. I've had tinder, bumble, and hinge for a while now but spent a few months just leaving them alone.

Recently I turned back to them as I'd really like to meet some new people and I'd love to have some dates lined up when coronavirus calms down. Or maybe just to talk to some people

But I literally get no likes on any of these apps. I try to reach out to my max people on hinge per day that seem like a good fit and swipe ""realistically"" on both bumble and tinder, but nothing ever happens. 

And then I talk to other guys I know and they say they're at least getting a handful of likes/matches per week and the issue is more that people don't commit to meeting or long term communication.

I'm starting to feel like I'm ugly and worthless. Yes, I am overweight, and maybe my pictures aren't great, but I've seen friends with popular profiles and their pictures aren't really composed any better, they're just better looking guys. 

I know I need to lose weight but there's this nagging sense that the body positivity movement has completely missed men, and us fat guys are not seen as sexual creatures at all. I know tons of ""big girls"" get attention whereas we just sorta fade into the background. 

I feel like if I magically lose weight and immediately get more attention that it's going to feel bankrupt, like anyone who pays attention to me is shallow. I don't want to be valued for my looks, I want to be valued for myself as a person. But I don't feel anything about me is valued and it feels really bad. 

The worst part is my women friends' advice on this is I just need to be ""happy being alone"". Never any supporting words or compliments about the person I am or anything like that. Yeah, I get that, but it's much easier to be happy alone when you have self esteem and feel valuable and feel like you have prospects in the world and that being alone is a choice rather than because nobody will spend time with you. 

My biggest issue is that I feel like I have a lot to offer but nobody ever sees that because nobody even matches with me to get a conversation started.

Honestly, I'm starting to have toxic thoughts about women, bros. The nagging sense that women are almost universally shallow creeps into my mind very often. I don't want to feel this but I see all sorts of absolute losers, total misogynists, who are good looking who never have trouble getting dates.

Yeah, I get confident is sexy, but how do you build self confidence when all the evidence to your life points to you not mattering much? It's hard to be confident and never be validated in that.

How do you guys wanna die?,"I think we all wanna die but how would you guys prefer it?

Personally I'm in two mindsets. I either want my death to be a complete mystery or highly publicized. For the mystery I basically wanna be missing/presumed dead like one of those Missing 411 cases, no bodies, no clues, just nothing to find. Remarkably unremarkable, good summary of my life

Either that or a 4 gauge in the mouth at a shopping mall or other highly public place. Fuck it, no one noticed or cared about my life so they might as well notice my death. And I want it to be messy, really fucking messy, like all my fucking head stuff flying in a big diameter, chunks of brain sliding down shop windows, specks of blood hitting disgusted pedestrians. Like I really want the person who's job it is to scoop my flakes of skull and chunks of brain to really fucking hate me for it. Only way it could be better if someone filmed it so even more people could see it.

They say when people commit suicide publically it's like a primal scream for just nothing, one last 'fuck you fuck off' to the world, a cause that wont matter as soon as you pull the trigger.

"What does it mean to be a ""courageous"" man ?","As a modern man I believe, courage can not come from shit talking to someone about politics or making controversial statement behind a digital mask of social media. I think courage, especially in difficult times like this comes from trying to help people despite going through hell yourself. I think somewhere, toxic masculinity has made arguments and screaming a ""courageous"" act. I think it's much more different to be optimistic or atleast act optimistic so people over the internet can feel a bit less scared about the future.

I come from a country which has big political schisms. The sad part is that the politics is attached with religion. I have stopped posting on all other socials because somewhere I realised I'm not healing my own mental wounds and if I don't control myself, I may bleed my demons on others. People don't realise that name calling and fear mongering over the internet scares so many people especially children, old folks and people that don't deserve more hate and anger in their life. Children are scared that that daddy and mommy doesn't belong to the ""right"" religion, and old folks are just scared that maybe their children are way too stressed in these strange times.

I wish these gym bros, biker dudes and macho men would realise how much pain and fear they can cause by a simple tweet or simple negative statement. It's not courageous to insult someone behind a wall and making disrespectful memes. It's way more manly to be hopeful and be positive to others even when you can't say so. It's way more manly to help others and be there for the fallen mentally and emotionally. It's way more manly to ask for help when the demons inside your head are getting too loud, so you don't end up giving those demons to your family.

That is until I got a text from her this morning saying she doesn’t think she can see me anymore. She goes to school very far away from where I do and is looking for something serious (as am I) but she doesn’t think it will work once we both go back to school.  

I can’t blame her for not wanting to do the distance thing because it does not sound appealing to me either, but I also really like her and idk how to deal with this on my end. 

I’m looking for a way to work through this in my own head. Moving on from this situation where things are great, but she just doesn’t think the future is going to work because of logistics. I can see her point, but I also hate to give up on something that makes me happy and I feel like is ending for no reason.

Women and the myth of emotional freedom,"Hey Broskis and Brosephines! I wanted to talk a little here about women's emotions

&amp;#x200B;

If there was one thing I would like men to understand about how society views emotions, it is that women are not allowed to be emotional either. I've seen alot of posts on reddit encouraging men to be more emotional, and a couple about how toxic masculinity is suppressing men's emotions. But I would like to dispel one myth: That it is any better for women. Because if society views women as emotional, and emotional is bad, then women will suffer for it. I don't feel that there is enough emphasis on the fact that women are allowed to be emotional as well. It is true that misogynists heavily exaggerate women's emotions, but that doesn't mean we aren't emotional at all.

Because right now, if you perpetuate the stereotype that women are overtly emotional, women will try and hide their emotions, because the second we show even the slightest bit of anger or sadness, we will be torn apart for it. For example, the case of Kamala Harris during the presidential debates. All I saw was a presidential candidate answering questions, but when she would push back, so many men called her ""too aggressive"" but didn't say the most about her male counterparts. Women must maintain an air of extremely queenly self control at all times to be even considered worthy of half the respect men are given, but if you slack for even a second, it's over.

What men need to know is that saying ""women are emotional"" is not a license for women to be human, it's a CRITICISM. They are gaslighting us, setting us up for failure.

The fight against toxic masculinity and this obsession with emotion must include women. Everyone has the right to be human, even women.",bropill,1593031855,JackieNaper1907,14,3,True,2020-06-24
It's weird.,"I don't even really know what exactly I want to this post, but I feel like I want to share it with someone that doesn't know me. It's also the first time that I open up anywhere on the internet, as I never had the need to do it up until now, and I really love the openness and care of this sub. Also please bear in mind that I'm not a native speaker, so there might be some errors in my grammar. 

I have a wonderful group of friends, they are supportive, caring and loving. They are all in relationships, but it almost never bothered me, since their SO are part of the group as well, and for a long time I've been in a relationship with one of them, we broke up in the best of ways and decided to stay friends, a decision which I think was one of the better ones we've ever made.
I only had a couple of gfs, but I am also very outgoing and social, never had any anxiety about meeting new people, and I'm always trying to be a good bro to everyone I meet, a thing that I like to believe I'm successful at.

But the thing is, because of my extroverted nature and the fact that (God it sounds narcissistic, but please bear with me) I work out a lot and look rather attractive, everyone I meet thinks that I'm a fuckboy, even my friends don't really believe me that it is hard for me to find someone I can be with. Unfortunately though, the thing that keeps me awake at night (it's almost 3AM here) is that I feel like I have to keep at least part of this image alive, mostly for my own sake. I like to be seen as the cool and easygoing dude, even though I often didn't do anything about the different girls I liked because of the fear of rejection. I have no idea when to do what, because the thing I fear even more, much more than rejection, is that I'll come off as a creep, a fuckboy or that I'll make some girl I want to ask out feel uncomfortable and objectified. That's also the reason why I never had any ONS, I always felt like I shouldn't want to have sex with someone who doesn't feel like I'm their best friend and who I know is 100% comfortable with me.  I really hate douchebags, to a point where by trying to be the exact opposite I sabotage my chances a lot of the times by not trying to be anything more than friends until I'm 100% sure that they are attracted to me and I won't seem like I'monly nice to them because I want something from them. I know that it might not seem like a big deal, but I have no idea how to deal with it. It has been building up for quite some time, but only when I started writing this post had I realised what the exact thing that I want to say is.

Elijah McClain Could Have Been Me,"Not just because he was black and they’re picking us off like flies in the street. 

Because he was small, wired differently from others socially, and was dancing to music on the way home, which the cops said was suspicious. 

I am all three of those things. I’ve been aware of my Aspergers since I was thirteen. I’ve stopped hating myself for it since 16. I’ve also danced to music outside with my headphones on. The only different between him and me is that I’m a girl. We both love cats, and neither one of us look in our twenties. 

When I read his transcripts, it sounded like something I would say in that situation too, desperately trying to explain and apologize for my wiring to save my life. I understood his mindset at once. That’s how much of myself I see in him. 

That’s how I know he was harmless. 

Nothing about his dancing on the way home could have been suspicious. He was peaceful, he spent his free time caring for stray cats FFS, and he was not a threat to anyone. 

And these racist bastards listened to his last words, pleading and apologizing, and it changed nothing. 

Reading his last words hit me too hard to keep my composure. It was too much like me. He was too much like me. And it’s those similarities that got him killed. And could easily get me killed. 

I wish I could tell Elijah he had nothing to be sorry for. He was perfect the way he was, and he was better for his differences. He did nothing wrong. Those cops did. And they will rot in hell while he plays the sweetest tunes for all of heaven.

Zoom Bachelor Party?,"I'm pretty new to this sub and have no idea if this kind of post is allowed. If it isn't, I'm sorry and I will definitely delete.

So long story short, my best friend is getting married in a few weeks. He, his fiancee, and another friend of ours recently moved to a new city, and the pandemic is still very much an issue in the US, so their wedding is going to be really really small. I don't even think their parents are going to be there. But hopefully we'll have a bigger party for them sometime next year when it's safe.

But it dawned on me yesterday that just because we aren't doing the party yet doesn't mean that he isn't still getting married, which means someone still needs to throw him a bachelor party.

I'm thinking of throwing together a Zoom bachelor party where we get all the bros on a call together to celebrate our buddy and the beginning of his new married life. The issue is that I'm not really sure what to do. I feel like most bachelor party activities aren't super doable over Zoom (and a lot of them we probably wouldn't want to do anyway- we're not really the kind of group to go to a strip club). So I was hoping some of you guys might have some ideas beyond a group of dudes in their mid 20s sitting on a video call and getting drunk together. Any thoughts would be super helpful- I'm pretty much at a total loss here.

Tl;dr: My best friend is getting pandemic married and I need help brainstorming how to throw together a pandemic bachelor party.

I’m skinny af. Been that way my whole life. Never felt manly. Never had confidence. Always mirin chads wishing I was big. 

So after years and years of low self esteem I finally sat my wife down and said yo, babe, what do you find attractive in other men. What is it about a guy that makes you stop your lady friends and point out a dude being like “he’s sooooo hot!”

She said it isn’t what clothes they wear. It isn’t what they look like, but they can’t be a troll. She said if they look clean and they are smiling while doing something they love, they are attractive. 

I was a little upset by that answer and my wife could tell by my facial expression and I thanked her profusely for her honest answer and told her that, yes, I am fishing for compliments to help build my esteem and I’m just kinda trying to figure out which bait works best. 

So her answer helped me a lot and after reading some posts here I thought it might help some others. 

Her bottom line, get out and do things you enjoy, after a shower. If you’re having fun and you’re clean, odds are someone is checking you out. 

I don’t know how this would translate for any bi or gay or trans scenarios. I did notice that this sub is very LGBT friendly, and I applaud you all. I say this because I identify as straight but I’d suck a dick in a threesome without a second thought. 

Anyways good luck. Take a shower. Go do something you enjoy, even if you suck!

Missing my little brother and kind of isolated at home,"Hey bros, my little brother, who is also my best friend, just flew across the country for a 6- to 12-week residential program to improve his health. He's only going to be able to communicate with me through letters which will be screened by the staff there; he's a closeted trans guy and the program is all-girls so I'm a little concerned about him even though he is good at making friends. He didn't get any say in the matter and he left yesterday, the same day both of us found out about it. I feel I'm not close enough to my friends from uni yet to talk to them about how I feel about this, and I don't know what I'm going to do without him. I usually spend most of my time with my brother and my dad is really busy at work, so a massive chunk of my life has just been ripped away from me.

What is the meaning of life (for you)? Suggested reading?,"Hey bros,

I'm in my 20s now, graduated college and working full time and I've been thinking a lot about what I want to do with my life. What is important and what I should focus my time on?

In my teens I spent basically all day watching TV shows and playing video games. I still enjoy doing that, but I've been started to realize that passively consuming media probably won't make me happy in the long term. I thought, that in 20 years if I looked back on my life, I wouldn't really have anything to show for it (except a job and stuff I guess). That's why I started picking up some more creative habits like writing and painting (only for a few minutes a day really) and they've brought me a fair share of joy.

However sometimes the thought strikes me that none of this matters in the first place. In 100 years I and I everyone I know will be dead, and in the grand scheme of the universe it's all so insignificant why would it matter if I spend my time playing video games or being actually creative?  

I also keep getting FOMO thinking that I should move to a way bigger city like New York or London, because that's where the cool events and concerts, but I'm not sure if this isn't just a regular case of the grass is greener on the other side. And again why does it matter if I experience a lot in my 20s (what seems to be the prime time for partying) if it all has an end and doesn't matter anyway?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if this has been rambly, basically what I'm getting at is that I would like to hear from people who are or have been in similar positions in life. How did you come to terms with what seems like the insignificance of life and everything we do? Also if you have any recommended philosophical reading or watching for me, I'd be glad to hear it!",bropill,1590786590,selib,12,2,True,2020-05-29

After some time lurking here I came to realize that most relationships could easily be solved if it were 2 healthy people making each other's lives healthier, also losing your virginity won't change you as a person at all.

Hey bro’s I just got done talking to my mom about my brother and how she should punish him. We always get into arguments when we try to talk about stuff,I know the title sounds weird but it weighing on my mind. My brother is ten and he has a tough time with school. I tried to be asked respectful as I can with my mom and try to bring up some stuff. She kept cutting me off and talking and I didn’t say anything. She started talking about her expectations for my brother to held responsible for everything he does. I said sometimes you put him into situations that he can’t help himself. She seemed angry and started ranting again. We talked some more and then she got really pissed and started to talk about al the stuff I fuck up and stuff. I said “ your telling me that you’ve exhausted every avenue “ and she replied about how I don’t have 4 kids and everything. Idk I think the points I brought up were valid and then she tries to say I’m wrong or I’m a hypocrite or I’m just not listening to her. I’m sorry if it’s long but I wish me and my mom could discuss things without getting in a argument. I try to be as respectful as I can while getting stuff off my chest and she takes everything to heart and makes me feel like an idiot.

Ghost posting,"Hi bros, first up lemme just say finding this sub has made my day, and it was a good day to begin with!

It also seems the ideal place to ask a question thats been on my mind the last few weeks when I browse reddit.

Often, when I see a post when someone is asking for advise, or validation, or even just wanting to vent, I find my self typing out a reply, spending quite some time rewriting it, shifting paragraphs around, altering the wording to try and better express what I am trying to say, etc, only to finaly give up, and cancel the post. Its rare that I can write a meaningful reply on such a topic that I am satisfied enough with to actually post. 

I've had my fair share of life experiences (41 mostly rough years to date, but life is kinda coming together now), and I'm sure at least some of what I have to say is worth someone reading, but I can rarely put that ""something worth reading"" into the right words.

Date Worries,"Evening Gents;  


I'll try and make this quick, I (M30) have a date coming up with a really cute girl (F25) this week. She seems really kind and friendly, and we share similar interests.  
Long and the short of it is I tend to hold most of my weight on my stomach, and have a bit of a belly/dad bod situation going on, and I recently found out that she likes to go to the gym in her free time, and looks pretty trim in her photos.

I'm starting to get nervous now that she will find my body shape unattractive, and might kill any interest she might have in me. The photos I use of myself are pretty representative of how I look, however, the last couple months of lockdown haven't been kind to my body shape (i.e. I sat around and snacked all day, only my fault).

Want to improve but don't know where to start,"Over the past few days I've decided it's time to stop feeling sorry for myself and try to improve. I'm not sure where to start but I have a few specific things I know I probably should work on.

First thing's first, here's why I feel bad about myself. I'm 26 years old and have two university degrees yet I'm still working in fast food. That's enough to make anyone feel bad, I know that much. As soon as more pandemic restrictions get lifted I'm going to go hard on job hunting though.

The next thing that makes me feel terrible is my lack of dating experience. My parents divorced at a young age and my step father was a decent enough dude but had a somewhat outdated view of masculinity. He was constantly on my case about not dating in high school, not dating in post secondary. When I tried to date it always backfired. So now here I am, 26 years old, never been on more than a couple dates with any one girl, and now it's getting to the point where seeing happy couples gets me depressed over something I feel unlikely to experience. So I guess what I want to improve there is undoing the mentality my step father gave me that I need to have a girlfriend and stop feeling sad because it's something I don't have.

Other than those specific points, I'm open to any sort of general advice on how to start my journey to becoming a better bro. I don't want to feel like my life has already stagnated at 26 years old.",bropill,1591041696,BurzumSpetsnaz,5,2,True,2020-06-01

Hello:) can a bro get some help settling cognitive dissonance?,"Hey y’all. I know everyone’s probably being having some super awful day, with the system of injustice us Americans live within, and none American bros either empathizing or getting caught up in the US centric news.

It’s lowkey hard for me to ask, but it’s been on my mind a lot. I usually try to do activism when I can, and marched and protested, made resource  guides etc. but I wanted to do something more, as well. I knew our police don’t wear body cams in my county. So I researched a good bit and started a petition for their mandatory funding and usage. 

The problem is I’m very much a leftist, (poc and trans as well) and those ideologies and the people who hold them can be rather inflexible, which isn’t all bad. From the studies I read, 

1. There isn’t a whole lot of data on the effects of body cams in the USA police force.

2. They can be effective in reducing public’s complaints, the use of force, and useful in settling conflicts

3. But only if the use is mandatory, and continuous. Otherwise it can just be a tool to frame citizens and aid in facial data.

Now my petition, combined with another students campaign that started after the murder of Ahmad, convinced our county leader to recommit to the funding of body cams, and it’s going to a vote this week. 

We are now working on ensuring the vote passes and there will be follow up legislation to make usage mandatory and continuous.

However, I’m getting a good amount of shit from the trans space I asked for signatures in. I’m usually not bothered by insults but the accusations I’m working for the system, and against my community cut deep, obviously. I know it is a small step, and increases police funding, while the ultimate goal in our communities is defunding. And I support that too, via others petitions and protests. But I know that will take a long time, particularly in my conservative community. I just want to increase police accountability where I live.

Feeling kinda down and empty,"(Using alt to stay anonymous)

Dear Bros. 

I have always valued you guys as a community. You have inspired me to become a better person.
Unfortunately I feel like I'm in a pretty shitty situation rn. 
In the past quite a few girls were interested in me and maybe still are. But there is only one who I really have developed feelings for.
I do however have the suspicion that I'm kinda friendzoned. But this isn't really what fucks me up. I really like her as a person and I feel like bluntly asking her if she likes me that way could maybe also make me lose her as a friend. I just hate the uncertainty of not knowing. Gives me Insomnia. Any tips on how to handle this situation? 

Thank you bros,
An anonymous friend",bropill,1591636206,my_true_feels,3,5,True,2020-06-08
"To my best friend from childhood and teenage years, I wish you all the best.","Hi to all bros from everywhere. I want to make this post in order to open up to this comunity, since I am new here, but you bros seem like great people. Here it goes.

I have a friend. We know each other from early childhood. We were allways ""compatible"", despite being different. He was allways more active and loud, I was a bit quiet. He loved sports, I loved books, he loved to play outside, I loved to play video games, etc. But, despite all of this, we were allways good and supportive friends.

During our early teens we didn't see each other at all. We just lived too far away, and didn't have means nor time to visit. This lasted untill, out of a sudden, we met each other on a bus and started talking. We realized that we independently developed simmilar interests in music, movies, fashion styles and so, and our friendship took of from where it ended few years ago.

Over time, due to life being what it is, we got separated again. We now live in different countries, do different things, and have grown appart again. I doubt we'll ever be as close as we once were, since we are really different people now.
Still, even after it all, I value our relationship and consider him close friend.

To wrap up this post, to my long-time-no-see but not forgotten friend: I love you, bro! I value the friendhip we had, and even tho we aren't as close as we use to be, I still consider you one of the most important people in my life! And if I ever find courage to tell you this in person, I will. But until that day come, I wish you all the best! I hope to see you again!


I've never found it this hard to writte a reddit comment, the words just don't come to me naturally. I'm sorry if I bored your, or this isn't the place to post this (I know you bros deal with much harder things then this). And at the end, thank you for reading this, and thank you gor wellcoming me to this comunity! I wish you all the best!",bropill,1591654948,OrdinarySlav,3,47,True,2020-06-08

Your bro needs to get off his ass... a little motivation couldn't hurt tho,"I tentatively commit to waking up everyday at 6am to run. I need to do it 6 days a week and I WILL(I'm hyping myself up). I also want to spend my time better. I spend a rough average of 8 hours a day on my phone or computer and I could really do something better with my time. I mow lawns for people(like 2 people as of right now) and since I don't have a job anymore, thanks rona, I should go door to door and just get the word out there that I mow lawns, at the best price I will say. But I don't. I play guitar and I want to get better, I need more goals. I need to learn more songs and what not to get better. I'm learning the solo from I'm Broken by Pantera right now, but I haven't been practicing like I should. And I'm working on my EP but I spend more time playing Rocket League instead of writing music/lyrics. I need to get better at singing so I can make this EP what I want it to be. But I suck at singing, which just means I can get better but it's hard starting from zero. I NEED TO HAVE A DAILY WORKOUT!!! I run, yes, but I'm skinny AF and I used to go to the gym a lot but since they're closed, I haven't been working out at all. Let's be honest, I'm losing right now. I have goals, however I need more. And a little motivation would go a long way for me. DON'T DARE TELLING ME TO BE PATIENT AND SAYING I'LL REACH MY GOALS ONE DAY!!! Sorry bros, I don't mean to flip any tables but I think that mindset got me into this, so I really want to stay clear of it.

I have a feeling a lot of people are in the same boat with me and something I want to say is... if you don't get it done today, it won't get done at all. Let that one sink, I think about it a lot.

Any motivation would be greatly appreciated. Be a drill sergeant, trust me, that would help a ton. It's all a mental game but having a push would be really nice. Rock on bros!!",bropill,1591763141,daddy_dave3,8,11,True,2020-06-09
On online friendships and loneliness,"Hey,

a topic I've been interested in recently is the dynamic of online ~~friendships~~ broships (think talking on discord, WhatsApp group chats, etc.) versus ""IRL"" friendships where you meet in person.

To what degree can online friendships be considered a replacement of offline friendships? Do online friendships merely augment offline friendships? Does relying solely on online friendships lead to increased loneliness over time? What about mixed friendships where you live in different countries and only see each other occasionally.

I think it's an interesting topic and would like to get a discussion started! (Literature recommendations are welcome as well)",bropill,1591784423,selib,2,8,True,2020-06-10

"I have trouble making friends, tips for when I go back (hopefully) in the fall?","I'm in high school, but because of that, I had to leave all of my friends behind last year since they all went to a different school. Middle school was great for me because I discovered a lot about myself, but now I'm kind of a mess because of it. I have a few of those people who I'll purposely sit next to in class because they're cool and we can chat but we're not like friends. Every day when school was still in I'd spend lunch and break sitting alone in my mom's classroom. I don't know where to go or who to talk to and I always feel like I'm intruding when I try to talk to other people. I was in a French club once a week, but just as I started feeling comfortable and opening up, the school closed. And most of the students in it that I liked were seniors.  I just have problems being open and talking to people and my weird amalgamation of interests just doesn't seem to have a place. 

It's kind of freaking me out for next year. A sophomore with just no place. I'm closer to teachers than any students.  I'm pretty sure most kids thought I had some slight disability with communication or socialization. I was always the kid who was told ""Oh you're so mature for your age"" and stuff. I'm just having a really hard time connecting to my peers, and even the friends that I had to leave behind purposely leave me out of things.

I don't know what it is, I know I close myself off, and I take a long time to warm up, but I just have problems connecting with my peers and I'm scared how it's going to connect to the future of my high school career. 

I'm sorry for the rant, it's just giving me a little anxiety and I need some help. I'm willing to improve and get better, but I still want to be myself and I don't know how to integrate it.",bropill,1589563155,colonialnerd,25,10,True,2020-05-15

(Kinda) Mid-Life Crisis,"Hi all,  


So I'll try and keep it simple. I'll be 31 in June and essentially, my life looks nothing like I had hoped or planned it would. My job is a mind-numbing dead-end bore-fest that's plummeted me into issues with depression and anxiety, but more importantly, my love life is pretty much desolate.  


Even from my teenage years I knew I wanted to be a family man, marriage, kids the whole deal. No idea why it was always so clear, but it's pretty much been the only thing I've ever been 'sure' of so far. When I look at my peers (specifically those in or around my age range), many of them are in serious relationships/engaged/married, and/or have kids or are about to have kids, whereas I see myself with no love-life to speak of.    


I try and do all the online dating crap (which I hate), but that all seems to have ground to a halt (it's been ages since my last match/date/actual conversation with a woman), and I starting to feel more and more that the life I always wanted is quickly starting to slip away from me day by day, and is fucking me up psychologically/emotionally.   


I have been in serious relationships before, even so much as being close to marriage and kids with someone before it all collapsed after 3.5 years together.  


I was hoping anyone on here would have some words of advice or guidance for my situation right now? This whole situation is really starting to eat away at me, and some help would be awesome.

I've been a porn addict for almost 5 years now. How do I stop for good?,"I just want to say that before we start, I really don't want to hear ""it's only natural don't get all worked up about it,"" in the comments. I don't care what it is, I don't like it in my life and I want it out. Nothing you can say will change that.
    
    
It starts in elementary school, when puberty starts to kick in and I start to fantasize wild fetish scenarios (not disclosing what it is). By the time I got my first iPad mini I couldnt help but wonder what kinds of videos I could find on YouTube late at night...
    
    
Fast forward to February. I (now 17 straight male) was just at Springhill camp, or if you didn't know a Christian youth retreat for a weekend in the winter. During small group time with our leader, he called me and my friends it for never fixing any of our problems. One bro had been suicidal for as long as we knew him, one was into drugs, and for me that was porn. 
    
    
I knew he was right. We all did. We had just been hoping that the problem would go away magically without any of our own work (or at least I was). So after that week ended I immediately began trying to cut it out.
    
    
I started with a regiment that decreased the number of days per week that I watched porn. After every week finished I took one day off the counter (first week had four days, next had three, etc). By the 2-day week I believed that I was doing good, but something got a hold on me, and alas, despite my efforts, I was back at square one.
    
    
This is why I don't like porn. Whenever I watch it, I feel possessed, like I'm not my real self. It almost feels like someone else takes the wheel and I'm forced to see what they do with my body. It's extremely uncomfortable; an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemies.
    
    
And speaking of being controlled, have you ever reached toward a girl's butt before you could realize what you were doing and the consequences of your actions, consider the girl was either a) an amazing friend or b) a family member? Yeah, after I relapsed things became incredibly bleak. Those statistics about porn watchers becoming serial rapists were starting to make sense in the worst way possible. I had to cut porn out once and for all, but I had no clue how.
    
    
So here I am now. I've got a new regiment. Rather than decrease the amount of porn I watch directly, I'm increasing the interval between porn sessions per week. This coming week I will have one day off porn followed by two days without, and after that I will have two days followed by three days without, and so on.
    
    
I'm actually pretty confident that this regiment will work, as I've had no problems with it for the month that I've been using it. My question today, and the reason for writing this entire long story is this. What can I do to ensure that one it's all said and done, I'll never look at porn again?

Coming out to my irl bros.,"Hi bros! I've recently come out to my closest friends as bisexual. Now, my female friends didn't seem to have a problem, but my male friends have been distancing themselves (and not just for the pandemic). I don’t blame them entirely, as the situation is new to them, as I live in a predominantly heterosexual community.


I have to add that I will never be attracted to one of my heterosexual friends, and I have been clear about it, as a matter of respect. My family has mostly been supportive and don't really seem to care, which I adore.


The problem lies in that, for example, I wont get invited for sleepovers, and what used to be a much more bro-like situation with some of my male friends (hugs, ""ily"", heart emojis, etc.) has now turned to a colder friendship with just smiley faces.

I know that I am privileged as all get out. How can I not be? I'm a white, Cis, het-passing, man in his mid thirties with a good job and my own house. My only two negatives are that I'm not NT, and that apparently I give off a vibe like a wolf stalking its prey, like I am literally hunting for something to eat, nothing I do gets rid of it. Even being polyamorous has no real negative impact.

All the privilege that I have and all my efforts to be a good person have left me feeling like I fit in nowhere.  I certainly don't fit in in traditional men's spaces, the ones that I have checked out around me are toxic as hell. Because I am so het-passing I don't fit in with the LGBT+ community.  Because of that weird predatory feeling I give off most women want nothing to do with me for obvious reasons.  The predatory thing and the impacts of me being not NT make it difficult to feel truly welcome in the polyamorous community.

Can't help but feel like i'm wasting my youth,"While i'm not really comfortable with saying how old I am, i'm in my early 20s, but ever since I was maybe 17 or so I had this feeling that I had to do something with my life while i'm young before I get too old to learn any skills. 

one of the only things that I can think of that might be interesting to learn are writing  but with writing I don't know if I can really improve since even though I don't really mind criticism (at least, I like to think I don't) I still get shy about showing something i've made to other people.

I didnt know who to talk with so i decided to talk with you bros, because i feel like im in some big bro family and this is important to me bros

So, im 14 years old and i live in argentina, here im learning electro mechanic but because of the whole coronavirus thing i will probably lose this year of practical studies (btw bros be careful out there just be safe ok), and I have recently thought of what im going to do with my life

I really like boxing, and racing bros, all the people from my school say im not manly enough because i dont like soccer wich is one of the main sports in here, but I dont listen to them bro, i like what I like and i wont change that

The thing is i dream of becaming a big boxer bro, just like one boxer from argentina, Nicolino Locche, i wanna be like him, a good defensive boxer
At the same time i started to like a lot races and F1 bros, i really like it, and I have some wild dreams of being one of the good ones

Can a bro get some support after a breakup?,"'Sup Bros!

Much love to each and every one of you. I've just had what is my first truly healthy relationship end abruptly. I (23M) was her (26F) first boyfriend, and she was the first non-toxic girlfriend after a long string of toxic relationships (both on my part and theirs; I acknowledge my faults). I tried to put in the work to make this a healthy relationship so I could make up for all the times in the past where I had been objectively shitty. She was a breath of fresh air and the fact that this relationship was mutually supportive, seemingly mature, and an actual give/take (not just one or the other) was so refreshing for me. There wasn't a day with her where I wasn't happy.

So imagine my shock when she met me at the park a few days ago (May 20th) and blindsided me. She did acknowledge my hard work and said I did everything wonderfully and perfectly. She told me that I was very sweet, charming, and a wonderful boyfriend, but the spark had just faded. She continues to cherish me as a human being, but can't imagine it working out romantically. We're going to keep things amicable once I recover because we do cherish each other and both of us are integral parts of our little friend circle. 

I believe from my experience that the elusive ""spark"" isn't necessarily a requirement or indicator of long-term compatibility, but if she doesn't want to stay then I can't make her. I'm very hurt by this as I thought we had been doing wonderfully. Tonight I was supposed to help her and her parents move her to a new apartment. I had a big meal planned for everyone, but she asked me not to come. So it's just me tonight. Some word of encouragement would be nice. However, please do not speak ill of her. That will neither be productive nor helpful.

Thank you for reading if you got this far.

How do I help my friend accept and ask for help?,"My best friend (28m) of about 14 years is having some health issues, he just had surgery today - big ass tumor inside his head giving him vision issues. He recently got out of a shitty relationship and has been living in his own, he's struggling financially a bit cuz he doesn't make a *ton*of money but he gets by and recently paid off some debt, but this surgery and hospital time is a huge set back.  

He's the kind of person who never asks for help until he's neck deep and if offered help he'll often refuse unless it's pushed on him. IE, when he moved out on his own I bought him tons of apartment stuff to get him started, brought it to his house and made him take it. He's always grateful for any help he receives and that's why I love the guy. He'd also give the shirt off his back if you needed it but he unfortunately doesn't have much to give very often.  

How can I help him accept or ask for help and be at least sort of ok with it? I can't force it I know, but have any of you guys ever been the same way but realized you may need help once in a while?

I think I lost a bro,"Just found this sub 10 minutes ago and I’m living for it. I love all the positivity and broness, but that’s not what this post is about.

After being friends with my bro for the last two years of college, and being attracted to him for the last year, I think I’m losing him.

He’s know I’m gay and was accepting, but I only told him I like him because he got a gf and started having her over most nights and i felt like a prisoner in my own home. I would isolate myself in my room but I could still hear them talking and it was a constant reminder that my feelings were doomed to crash and burn.

Thankfully, when I told him about it (like April 2nd), he was understanding and we came to a mutual agreement that I was in a shitty situation and that he would go to his gf’s house from now on (she was also made aware and agreed).

I realize it was a lot to ask if them, but I was seriously sinking to some unsavory mental places when she was here.

But now, he’s been distant, stopped saying hi to me when he gets home which we both used to do consistently, and he doesn’t try to find time to hang out with me anymore.

I can’t pretend I know what it’s like being a straight guy and having it revealed a guy friend has romantic feelings for you, so ig id like some insight into that.

How would y’all feel if you were in his place? Is what I’m asking them to do unfair? I’m in a constant struggle of feeling like I’m throwing myself a pity party and being genuinely concerned for my mental and physical health. I’ve been working on not invalidating my feelings but it’s a tough road.

I'm an out and proud bisexual and he is definitely more straight possibly Questioning. 

His response was that he wasn't sure how others on campus or in his personal life would accept that part of him, and that certain friends' opinions about homosexuality and being gay would just make him feel unsafe to come out, which broke my heart.

It's clear that this is not the first time hes thought of stuff like this and how it might effect his personal life but he deserves to be loved for who he is.

"What have learned from being the ""dad"" in brolationships","At this point all of my boys call me the dad of our group. I am always the one taking care of everybody, listening to problems, finding solutions to problems, helping out and generally be the one that cares about everything and over the time I noticed that most of the issues are similar or stem from the same roots and I thought maybe my online broskis and brosises would like to hear it, so here goes nothing 

1. 90% of all your problems can be influenced by you and about the remaining 10% you shouldn't give a damn 

Most issues you encounter in your daily life can be fully influenced by you, this does not necessarily mean that you have all the control over it, but for a certain degree you can influence it. The easiest example is training, you have full influence over your body, what goes in and what you do with it, going to the gym and eating healthy can be controlled fully by you. Your mental health can be, not fully since we are complicated beings, influenced by yourself, the food you eat, the exercise you do, the people your surround yourself with, the mental attitude you perpetuate in your own mind. Furthermore you can influence how people look at you by your behaviour towards them. I think that generally people underestimate the influence they have in their own lifes which creates a feeling of ""watching"" their life instead of participating in it. Understand this, that at any moment you could just stop anything you are doing and completely change your behaviour and surroundings.

BUT dont be toxic towards yourself, dont blame yourself for being in a bad position but rather have a healthy mindset of ""how can I influence and improve this situation"", just sit down in silence and think, but really think about, AND THEN LISTEN TO YOURSELF. You are a smart person you will know what to do, you have full control. 

And if there is any point where you say, I have 0 influence on this (worst case scenario:  a meteor hitting earth) why worry about it? If you have done everything you could, it is beyond you.

If you change it, why worry about it?
If you cant change it, why worry about it?



2. DO IT NOW. DO IT NOW. DO IT FUCKING NOW
If you can do it immediately do it, what are you waiting for? If you improve your health by stopping smoking, exercising, eating healthy etc why aren't you doing it now? What lame as excuse are you still chewing on? Do it now. If it isn't done now, it will never be done, you know this better than I do, still you get deceived by yourself. If get this a lot and it really annoys me, people come to me with problems, we talk them out and find really good solutions and then I hear the classic ""yeah but I cant do this rn"" and when I ask why I get 99.999999% the dumbest answers, some fucked mental gymnastics (""my water pipe broke, I can't stop smoking""????????????) or that classic awkward 3982273838 years silence and then ""ohw you mean now?"" Yes I do idiot. Start fixing problems the second they arise, if you feel bad mentally find out why or get help (professional or the dadbro of your trust), if you notice that your relationship doesn't work as good as it did before, try to improve it IMMEDIATELY. if your tooth starts hurting, get that checked out. IF YOUR WATER PIPE IS LEAKING GET IT FIXED INSTEAD OF WATING 4 MONTH AND THEN HAVING IT BREAK COMPLETELY 

If you are focused on the things you can improve and your responsibilities and fulfill them as fast as possible, you wont have to worry a single day in your life again. Just doing this will remove 60% of your problems immediately 



3. ITS INEVITABLE!!!
Yes you are right, it is. You can't outrun it, it will catch up to you. It's okay tho, it's not a special case with you, nothing personal with you. You might be having a bad time now or are in a bad place but its inevitable, nothing you can do about it. The good times will come, the inevitable good will catch up to you. No matter how bad things seem, all of it will be gone one day. All of the bad things go away, no matter how disastrous, monstrous and diabolical they might seem, those times will pass. The good times are inevitable. Always keep this in mind, it might hurt like hell, it might feel like everything around you is collapsing and this would ruin you forever, no it wont and it will pass. It's often times hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel but keep in mind, just a few sparks can light up a lot of darkness. Stay on track and if you are going through hell, push through, one day you will be out of hell. Walking through hell sounds like doing cardio in a really hot sauna which is probably amazing exercise 



4. Confidence, Hope and Happiness 
These three have something in common, something a lot of people get confused by. While all of these can be based on external confirmation and validation the true source is internal. Dont base your confidence on the perception of others, it comes from deep within. From being based in you being comfortable and proud of you being you, be comfortable with yourself and it you dont like something about yourself, which you can change (e.g weight) do it but dont let that influence your own perception, you being jacked vs you being slim (in my mind you all are swole af and 9 feet high) should NOT influence how confident you are. Your confidence comes from you being yourself, proudly. You are amazing they way, you are truly you. Keep that in mind and remind yourself if needed. Same goes for happines, whilst we might receive happines for 10min from the shiny new material we have bought true happines can only be achieved from within. Have a positive mindset, be grateful, have hope that anything and everything will get better. Dance like a idiot alone in your room at 4am, draw the most horrendous sketch humanity has ever seen, bake the worst cake Gordon Ramsay has spit on multiply times, try built something and fuck up completely. Do things that make you happy and proud, no matter how bad or good you are at it, no need to prove jack shit to anybody. Make yourself happy, love yourself. You are worth everything, you are amazing. Dont let your fears chain you down, rather face them with confidence and let your fears shiver the second they see you marching towards them, confidently and happy. 



5. Your feelings are valid and emotions dont make you less manly 

This is all to say to it, nothing to elaborate. Smile, laugh, sob, cry, scream. You are a human being, you have emotions, doesn't matter what gender you are (or see recognize yourself as). You can be sad, you are allowed to cry. I cried, I cried and sobbed for days in my bed the day I lost my grandfather to cancer. I had horrendous mental health and was at my lowest low and felt like dying, you can do too. You are not the fetishized idea of man from a fucked culture that denied them any types of emotions. Acknowledging your emotions and expressing them to others does in fact make you stronger, because in a world where everyone is taught to hide their feelings, how strong must be the one who can show them openly? Incredibly strong.

"Poetry about my experience with depression, hope it helps","Sunlight

If you have ever experienced sadness, you know. 
If you have ever experienced anger, you know. 
If you have ever experienced loneliness, you know. 
If you have ever experienced confusion, you know. 
If you have ever experienced insecurity, you know. 
If you have experienced depression, you know. 
You know life will feel like a long walk through a dark world.
A world that hasn’t been touched by sunlight for years, as if the world just stopped turning that day it really began and it will never turn agan.
You have felt it slow down but now it has lost all its momentum. 
And like a world where there is no sun, its cold and dark. 
There is no difference when you wake up. 
It’s a new day but without the sun, can you be sure? 
All you can do is keep walking. 
Like a sunless world, there still is some light, street lamps, that guide your way. 
And if you are lucky you might even have a torch. 
Some people with a torch feel like it’s burning them and cast it away. 
It’s neither their nor the torches’ fault. 
Those lights however never feel the same. 
You can see the light, feel the light on your skin but it is not the same, so, you move on. 
You keep walking your path. 
For some people their eyes took too long to adjust to the darkness. 
They couldn’t see what was in front of them.
Because of that some people got injured when the darkness came. 
Some people fell, others got pushed. 
If you are lucky enough you can find a crutch to help you keep moving.
Some people choose to stop and hope to find the sun up there. 
Which sounds like the best place to look if you have been walking for long enough. 
But like a world that has stopped turning, if you walk long enough and you can find your way, you will eventually feel the sunlight on your skin again.

I think I'm maturing but I'm not sure if I want to (possible admission to Unbrolike behavior),"Not sure if this belongs here, but it seems as good a place as any.

I think I'm maturing but I'm not sure if I want to.  In the past few months (potentially year, who keeps track any more) I've been learning more about politics.  What struggles other people go through, how to help them, what hurts them ect, you know real human being type shit.

And I think I've been trying to find myself as well, questioning every aspect of my personality no matter who minute from identity to morality.  So far I've come out mostly the same, but I still have serious questions about morality and whether or not I am.

So this in some way has manifested to my more creative side.  Little stories I have in my head about stories that I may or may not write.  Futures that could never be, purple prose yada yada yada.  And in a lot of them, is this guy who has to give up what he wants so that someone else could be the hero (usually a minority, or not, like 50/50) or he's some guy over worked trying to help everyone because every cause is so important. 

I know this is some weird ass ""white man's burden"" or some other thing like that (weird since I'm not white, but I guess I was raised middle class in a pretty homogeneous town, richest country on Earth, man, you get the idea) since I'm not currently helping people and I'm probably just fantasizing about scenarios where I'm so kind of martyr like an asshole (I'll get to that later).  I think there is also some learned misogyny? racism? privledge?  whatever where if I write this story, that guy gets the best story ever despite that plot point (either 1st or second happen).  I don't know if that's just some reactionary programming bullshit, selfishness or feeling marginalized to find out I'm not the guy the world revolves around, I'm not the protagonist (more on this later too).  Sometimes he goes after the main protagonist (like the actual guy who did the thing) and fight him (because in the words of Ric Flair ""To be the Man, you gotta beat the man!"") and I want so desperately to be the man.

I grew up on hero shit.  It was and still very much is, what I base my world view around.  Morality is black and white, because every shade of grey is lighter that the other and you do the best you can with what you have (vote Biden through the most gritted of teeth).  But when I was young I was lonely, no real friend until 5th grade, parents weren't around much at this time (they wanted to provide for me best they could so no brothers or sisters) and I was a lonely kid, but I escaped through media, comics, anime whatever.  I wanted to be like my heroes.  At first I loved the cocksure, kinda arrogant, flies by the seat of his pants, head long into danger and come out the other end alive, cause he was smarter than just about anyone (even if he was dumber) (think Nathan Drake, Shawn Spencer, that kinda guy) and I still do, I think because of the coolness, the one liners and the idea that things work themselves out.  I wonder sometimes if that does have to do with privledge, that kinda fantasy, where it could be real, just go out and not give a shit what happens next cause things work out for you.  But I always loved the moral protag.  Moral and good above all else.  Superman, Spider-man, Deku, those guys have been my guiding light post highschool (I'm a 20 year old dude who had a massive breakdown junior/senior year) about who I want to be, no matter how outlandish.  I want to be like them more than anything else in the world.  I want to be the hero.  And I have no idea what that means.

Do I want to do good?  Do I want to be great?  Do I just want to be important?  I have that fantasy sometimes too, post saving the world and giving my thoughts on politics, making the world the best it can be by just saying a word.  And sometimes its the most selfish I ever feel.  Why do I deserve that, what have I done.  I'm just some dude, who gave up on engineering because he wouldn't do the work.  I never volunteer, I never write my stories, what makes me so goddamn special.  Everyone who I idolize is a better person than me and that's why I idolize them.  I'm not good enough to be them.  And sometimes I feel so alone.

And I don't wanna tell my friends this, I barely just started opening up to them about recent stuff with school and my parents are cool, but I don't feel like I can or that I should.   Only other person in my life is my ex-girlfriend, who even after we broke up, never really left my side, she helped me so much and I can never repay her.  She kept me alive in those last two years of highschool and I wanted to be the best boyfriend I can to her cause I loved her (still do I guess ) and she was the first person to ever really take a chance on me, but now that were broken up (still friends) and this Corona shit is going on I can't just make her my personal therapist she's got a life way harder than mine with so much more shit going on, I don't want that to just be our relationship.

So I tell you this after reading an article on the dadification of video games.   [Here's a link if you wanna read it.](https://killscreen.com/previously/articles/dadification-videogames-round-two/)  (Side note I sometimes forget why this stuff in video games is important.  Like I know represenation and why focus on one demographic, unfairly catered too, but I forget sometimes and I still can't tell if it's a bad thing) And I didn't want Joel or Geralt or whoever to go away because to some degree I saw them in myself or whatever.  I want to be the hero.  And I know I don't deserve it.  But I want it so bad.  Whether it's me reaching out for adventure, importance, attachment or fame I don't know.

I think this is me realizing the world doesn't revolve around me, but I don't know if I want to go through with my maturation.  Because what's my story arc later?  What is the point of idolizing those guys if I know I can't reach their morality, their importance, their will to help others no matter what and to do what's good.  If I accept I can't be them, do I stop trying all together?  If I can't be like them, how do I reach my best self, cause he would follow them, he would be his best no matter what.  He would never prioritize his needs in front of others, he wouldn't have these bullshit problems, he would be the hero anyway, because he was worthy to be.  He might not have earned it but no one could think of someone better.  He would get that ""you did good kid"".  He would.  And if I stop trying to reach the outrageous goal of being like them, of being the most good I can be and never faltering, where do I land?  What do you say to that guy, who was never good enough?

Double problem post,"Ok bros, I have 2 problems that I've been having for a while, help me out please.

Problem #1: 

My dad says I gave him his heart illness because I stressed him that much. I'll admit it, I was never the most hardworking kid and I'd consider myself a lazy shit sometimes. Because I would not do my schoolwork unless it was a very important project, my dad kept telling me to do my schoolwork and I'd usually ignore him, then he'd yell at me and we would start arguing. I was a really stubbord kid.

Now, my dad needs to take heart medication daily so he doesn't die and I know it's my fault. I can't stand feeling all this guilt. What can I possibly do to stop feeling that way or get used to it? Every time dad says it I need to go away and cry. It's the only thing that makes me cry currently.

Problem #2:

Almost a year ago, I had to cut off one of my best friends because I found out he was talking shit behind our backs. We were a group of 5 people and we were all basically best friends. When I found out, everyone except one guy cut him off and I miss having him as a friend.

I started thinking about unblocking him and apologizing for how harsh I was when I told him to fuck off out of my life.

Worst part is, he was my first male friend I made properly. I'm ftm, so it's always been weird in some way or other with my male friends. I'm real sad and not looking forward to the next few weeks/months/however long this goes on for.

Also, he is sorta okay. He went to stay with friends. I and a few other people offered to help/lend money, etc. so I think he will be okay. So I've allowed myself to feel sorry for myself for a bit.",bropill,1586423263,iuzyrneim,43,1,True,2020-04-09

Advice for helping a bro going through a tough time?,"Hey bros, I hope you're all doing well.

An IRL bro of mine is going through a tough time and I feel like I've exhausted my options for helping him out. He has a history of drinking too much and having emotional breakdowns afterwards, and with the current lockdown situation due to COVID-19 he has more opportunity to drink. I had a long phone call with him during the latest episode and he said all kinds of things about how he feels worthless because of trouble finding love and having his plans for this year derailed, and hinted that he's been having suicidal thoughts because of it. He also mentioned that his family environment isn't supportive of taking care of one's mental health, which I had suspected for a while. 

Myself and our mutual friends are a very open and supportive environment and we do our best to advocate for each other, but having that support network hasn't seemed like enough to get him the help he needs. I encouraged him to seek professional help but he couldn't get over the hurdle of his family finding out and judging him. 

I guess I'm just at a loss for what to do, beyond continuing to be there for him. Any advice you could give would mean a lot.",bropill,1586582019,claire-somewhere,6,1,True,2020-04-10
Hardcore punk and positive masculinity,"So, I listen to hardcore punk on a daily basis. In fact, as of now, it's the only music I listen to, with a few exceptions here and there. I was thinking about the raw energy, violence, aggression, and hatred in the beat of the songs, the vocals, the way the instruments are played, to create this dark, miserable, enraged atmosphere. This exists alongside often anarchist, left-wing lyrics, themes, and creative expressions. 

I was watching this video of one of Pg. 99's shows, where you had violent, pain inflicted screaming, really masculine dudes shredding guitar chords, and an almost entirely male audience going wild, cheering and rocking out. At one point, one of the band members got up to announce something, that the organisations the band worked with, while on tour, performing concerts, were grassroots platforms fighting for social justice, wishing to restore justice for marginalised demographics. And, I thought, ""This is really cool.""

I didn't expect such a political message in a scene one, if not familiar with hardcore, and punk in general, would expect to be very right-wing dominated, infested with authoritarian, inegalitarian, and misogynistic themes. However, I was pleasantly surprised, the whole hardcore scene, in whichever state, restoring my faith in humanity a little. Despite being incredibly masculine individuals, playing really intense, violent, angry music, their emotions were conducted to spread messages of peace, solidarity, and equality, as opposed to punching down on already oppressed, discriminated against peoples.

I think this is, honestly, an extremely good example of masculinity, where the big, angry, tough guy utilises his strength and intimating looks to be aggressively nice to others, to lift hurt people up, as opposed to pushing them even further down. The band members of Pg. 99 are all really cool people, who see their music as creative self-expression, as a release from the chains of capitalism and authority, where they're capable of relaxing, of being themselves, while having others share such an experience, such a sensibility.

Punk has always rocked against racism, fascism, terrible right-wing politics and states, and so on, throughout its historical course. I feel this is such a great expression of masculine energy, and I hope more are able to enjoy it.",bropill,1586794838,greenruins09,11,10,True,2020-04-13

"I can't help my girlfriend anymore, and it's killing me.","Throwaway bc my girlfriend follows my main.

I feel so lost right now. For the past 2 and a half years I've been dating this wonderful girl who has given me a new insight on life, made me happy, and made me feel a real connection. She has been my best friend through everything, and she knows all there is about me. I've done everything in my power for her, and she has for me. But things haven't been looking the greatest recently.

A few months after we started dating, I found out she's bulimic and has self-harm tendencies (cutting). I helped her with the bulimia to the point where she went from multiple times a day to once every 6 months, but the cutting was different. She only cut herself, as far as I'm aware of, once in our relationship...and oh man, that shit makes you feel horrible when you hear about it. I was very upset, not at her of course, but at myself because I felt like I failed her. I never wanted to go through that amount of sadness again. 

But I didn't show my sadness to her, I hid it because I couldn't imagine how she felt. I wanted to comfort her. She's all that mattered.

This began a habit of me not expressing my feelings, and of course causing my mental health to be strained. But I barely told her about it because I was afraid of adding stress to her life. 

Fast forward to the last few months. She began to get bad again. She started throwing up more often, and my amateur therapy wouldn't help her (she got a professional therapist actually, but they barely meet, and she can't change that). Then she tells me her life feels stagnant; that all she ever does is work and go to school. That she has no free will. That she's not accomplishing anything. So, I urge her to apply for opportunities: for things to do outside work and school. She does, and she actually gets all of them! 

Life seems to be looking up for her. She's really excited, and for a moment I saw her old self come back. But then the fucking Corona virus came.

The virus caused a few of the things she applied for to be cancelled, and as you can imagine, she's crushed. She had the worst day on Friday. Other things happened that day in addition to her events being cancelled that just caused her to have a mental breakdown. It was crushing for me to see. I felt, and still feel, horrible about it. 

As per usual, I comfort her, do things for her, but none of it works. She tells me she doesn't feel anything anymore, including love, and that she was finally happy before the virus struck. She does impulsive things like party real late then sleep at a guy's house she just meant (she wasn't going to cheat, she was just being dangerous). I tell her that she shouldn't do that because it puts you in a vulnerable position and that I wasn't comfortable with it, and she just yells at me. 

Then today, she tells me she's going to cut herself when she gets home. I try and tell her not to but I end up coming across more aggressive then I meant by saying ""I can't be with you anymore if you do."" To which she replies: ""Fine, that'll just add fuel to the flame."" 

This says to me that she doesn't care about me or herself, and that anything I do won't work. She even said herself that she's ""unfixable."" 

I've never made a post about this or talked to anyone about it, but I came home crying after she said that and I just needed to rant. Sorry for the long post. Thank you for reading kind soul.",bropill,1584327321,ttreemaker0402,24,1,True,2020-03-15
My ex tried making me get back together with her because she saw me being vulnerable,"This started happening about a week ago, when I went to my friend's birthday party and the only way I could get there was if my ex gave me a ride there.

Because I wasn't comfortable there, with the loud music and a ton of people, I mostly stayed outside and alone. My ex came and we started talking and I told her I still had feelings for her.

A couple days later, at school, my ex wanted to talk to me and tried to pressure me into getting back together with her, saying she's learned from her mistakes (we broke up twice before, due to constant arguing, which she claims to not remember, and me being used as a living dildo, despite me telling her I didn't want to do anything). Eventually she tried to lure me in by saying she'll let me fuck her and she learned from everything and I almodt fell for it.

I should also mention I feel alone and I can't stand being alone. This relationship lasted a year+ and after that, being alone again just makes me feel scared and hopeless.

We were sort of friends for a few days before I finally figured out what was going on and I told her. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest, bros. I hope it's fine if I do it here. Also, I'm sorry if this is poorly worded, English is not my first language.",bropill,1584388536,Nae_Bolonz,9,1,True,2020-03-16

how much negativity is too much in a friendship?,"hey bros,

I met a girl online recently and we've been talking a fair amount. she's not a super positive person, and has a tendency to be negative to herself/towards others. in the past ive been in toxic relationships, and i think it's because i'm empathetic to a fault, and 99% of the time i'll make others feel better before i do it for myself.

anyways, this also leads to her being 'mean' to me. it's not particularly hateful, or often, but it's putdown humor; like she'll say stuff like ""i know, you're dumb"" or ""that's stupid"" etc. again, it's not horrible stuff, she's not telling me to kill myself or that i'll die alone etc. i'm just afraid that with her negativity in addition to that that the relationship could lead to something more toxic.

so bros, what do you think? i like talking to her and i've gotten her to stop being as mean to herself, but i also don't want to get myself trapped in a relationship i'll be reluctant to leave.",bropill,1584657556,TradeGuineapigPicsPM,2,1,True,2020-03-19
"Bros, what do you wear when you want to look cool?","Disclaimer right at the start, don't worry Bros, I'm very comfortable with my looks and the clothes I have. This is more a question out of interest. Question at the bottom

My wardrobe is made up of T-Shirts, hoodies, shirts, sweaters and jeans. For formal occasions I wear a suit. The most unusual clothes I have are a pair of Harem pants I wear to Festivals and sometimes at home when I'm relaxing, I like my wardrobe, I think all the T-Shirts I have suit me well, and when I look into the mirror, I like what I see.

But, if there's one things I envy women for it is the variety of fashion and types of clothing offered to them. I have many very good looking friends, and I'm impressed by the great looking and creative outfits they sometimes assemble when we go out, go raving or whatever. Obviously not always, who has the time to come up with something creative every time they leave the house lol, but still, sometimes I think I'd like to be able to get creative (or impress i guess) with my clothes, maybe when I go out or to some kind of gathering, I'd like to be able to do more than just choose a T-Shirt that looks good.

TL;DR: So, Bros, my question is basically what kind of clothes do you wear when you want to look cool? I don't mind if it's specific pieces of clothing, a style, a suggestion where to look, or ideas for combinations! Also, I'm just interested to see if any other men feel about this like I do.",bropill,1584786344,Benkinsky,49,1,True,2020-03-21

I don't know what is going on with my best friend rn,"Hi bros, hope you are doing well, I would like to have some advice. I don't have that many friends but I sure do have the most awesome best friend of all times. We have the greatest time together. It has never been a problem in our friendship that I'm straight and he's gay. We have our own (both very not successful lol) dating lives. However, his behaviour has changed a lot in a few weeks. 

Since the corona pandemic has now spread here in Europe, he has stated that he doensn't really care about seeing other friends than me. Before this, we have usually cuddled only if we are heavily drunk but now he has started asking me for a cuddle more often, which I agree on, cuddling is nice.  We very rarely talk about looks but recently I have noticed he has started commenting on my looks in a positive way and he told me I'm definately his type.

I know I am an complete idiot when it comes to any of these romance things, and I don't know if I'm just getting everything very wrong. Maybe the stress from this corona situation is making him feel he wants to be closer as a friend. But what if he has starting to have a crush on me? I like to give him positive comments too on his looks and cuddle sometimes, but I wouldn't like to give him wrong signals.

I desperately need some bros,"I've recently ended a toxic 7 year relationship (My post history has the details). She was my only friend for many years, and I had become emotionally dependent on her. This was an extremely fragile position to be in. My self esteem has collapsed in her absence. I've watched the video ""Men. Abuse. Trauma"" by Philosophy Tube twice a day for the last few weeks. Anyone who's seen that video will have an inkling of what I'm going through. I'm not angry at her anymore. But I'm not coping. I have moments of clarity between long stretches of isolation and self-loathing. I've resorted to self-harm and suicidal ideation. I don't have access to mental health professionals, although I've had a counselor in the past, and she has taught me some coping methods. I'm aware that there are subreddits for depression, but I feel like that's the last place on the internet I need to be right now. I need a positive environment. My father died when I was a child, and subsequent male father-figures have been alcoholic abusers. The closest thing I have ever had to a father figure, was a programming professor who happened to be an amazing person.  


I'm glad it's over, but a big block of my foundation is just gone, and I feel like I'm sinking. I've recognized that what I really need is friends, but my current situation has me trapped in a small town for at least a year. The supportive comments on my last post probably saved my life.

I dropped out of university to help my single mother run her business, but I'm trying to move somewhere with more people, where I could hopefully have friends again. I'm fairly interested in geo-politics, history, and military equipment.

"Bros, is it normal to be insecure about your height?","I am a trans man (female to male trans person), and I stand 1 feet 7 over the ground (170 cm). This is probably a good height considering my biology and an average height overall, but at the same time I feel short compared to my biologically born male friends.

There's a lot of pressure being put on both men and women, from how thin, beautiful or ripped one should be. I feel the pressure to be strong, tall and handsome. I don't think I have those qualities, though. 

I have almost always had low self confidence, and I think others may view me in a more positive light than I view myself. I'm trying to work on that.

porn free update: 2 weeks in,"This ones kinda long, TLDR a the bottom

hello! [I made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bropill/comments/f3m3so/pornfree/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about 2 weeks ago saying that I am attempting to go porn free. Still masturbating, but without visual stimulation. I have a lot of good things to share!


- just to be clear, I am a straight male bro, but if any girl bro’s are struggling with porn you should read this too because it still applies -


First off, as mentioned in [the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bropill/comments/f3m3so/pornfree/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), masturbating without porn is 100 times better than with. After 2 weeks, I can only say that even louder. It’s weird, I obviously felt like I enjoyed porn, but I realize now what I was missing out on. 

It’s my routine now that every 2 to 3 days I deep clean my bathroom, run a bath, light a candle, put on some music to set the mood, and go to town. It’s GREAT! When’s the last time you actually felt ENERGIZED from jerking it? Up until 2 weeks ago, I couldn’t even remember that feeling. 

After my session earlier today, I got out of the bath, dried off, and cleaned my entire apartment. That’s rare for me, but especially right after masturbating. Back when I was watching porn, I would immediately crash after I came. My whole day ruined, no motivation or energy at all. 

My best advice to those who want to stop watching porn is: you have to TREAT YOUR SELF. 

Like I mentioned earlier, take your time and make it special. Run a bath, find the right music for whatever fantasy/mood you’re feeling, clean up the room a little bit, etc. Create an environment where you can really focus. 

Ever since I started doing these things, my interest in porn is steadily declining. Earlier today, a pornstar that i’ve watched before popped up on my twitter feed. I saw her, thought, “nice, boobs”, but I didn’t even have an urge to watch porn after that. 3 weeks ago if I saw a one piece swimsuit in a movie I would’ve decided it was time to load up the ole hub. 

You have to make your brain realize that porn is not the ultimate pleasure, and it really isn’t. Reclaim your imagination!

As far as how this has affected my general mood, this change in life won’t fix all your problems. I still have depression, still feel down all the time. BUT! My daily decisions are no longer the cause of these feelings. That brings me some peace of mind. AND now masturbating is an effective way to give my brain some dopamine without making me sadder in the long run. 

This has been a great change in my life, obviously everyone is different but I highly recommend at least trying pornfree, there’s nothing to lose.",bropill,1582527029,reeeeeeebruh,9,1,True,2020-02-23

Let's Talk For Real,"I'm feeling pretty angry about this, maybe don't read this if you don't have space for that right now. Take care of yourself.

I'm seeing a lot of ""woke"" brands talking about de-stigmatizing mental health issues, and I'm wondering what my fellow bros are thinking about this. What does it really mean to de-stigmatize mental health issues? What does that look like?

Psychosis is ugly, and painful, and hard to look at. I haven't experienced it nearly as bad as other people have, but I know it well enough to know it's not something a respectable company is ever going to put in an instagram ad. I don't believe that any corporation wants to be represented by that. It's like the flavor of the month to hold your own corporate mental health gala to discuss how we can all work together to ""end mental health stigma"", meanwhile if you look like you have a mental illness or you look poor they probably wouldn't even let you in the door. It's so frustrating to see people I follow on social media share these inspirational posts with ""BELL"" in giant letters and ""lets talk"" as the subheader. It just seems so transparent what the intentions of the company are to me, but I understand if you disagree with me on this.

It seems like everyone wants to talk about mental health. Everyone wants to acknowledge that it exists and hold that as an abstract in their minds, but no one wants to *look* at it. Nobody wants to look at the poverty and isolation that create it. Nobody wants to be around somebody with borderline or schizophrenia or intense anxiety. They just want to talk about it in safe conference rooms where the crazies and tweakers can't get them, and pat themselves on the back for how progressive they are. Nobody wants to look at themselves, and see the honest to god disgust they feel. Don't believe me? Ask yourself how you feel about incels. Or old men who cross-dress. They're experiencing dysphoria. That's what mental illness looks like. It doesn't make you a bad person if you react that way, but if were really going to de-stigmatize mental health issues it's time to really consider whether that's helpful.

Edit: upon rereading this it's pretty disjointed and idk even how to fix it. I don't even hate companies doing mental health awareness things tm, it's just hard to look at when you aren't neurotypical and it looks like it's made about you for neurotypical people... or something. I don't know. 

Also as a side note ya'll probably don't remember the specific post which is ok haha but I made a really feelsy post here a while ago, and only responded to one of the comments because I felt overwhelmed and then you reach that point where it seems too late. I just wanted to say I read them all and they meant a lot to me and I'm glad this sub and the humans in it exist. Keep up the good work bros :)",bropill,1580422828,manonaraft,15,1,True,2020-01-30

A cute personal story about M2M affection,"So for the background, I’m a lonely child raised by a single mom, who gave me all she had in her life. That included lots, lots and lots of affection!

That means that, naturally, I have a tendency to just be out there and be nice to people, hug people, because I just really like to give and receive love. However, most of the people I know are not very fond of the “man to man” affection. They justify theirselves by saying they’re “not very physical and don’t like unnecessary contact”. It sucks for real.

Most of the time I believe it might be because I’m bi so guys are afraid that it might mean something more. However, I respect, and I don’t invade people’s space when they make it clear that it’s not cool. So that means that I’ve never really known the feeling of just being loving with your bro and have him love you back, and actually express is physically.

But two weeks ago, I met this awesome guy who was legit the friendliest person I’ve ever met. Naturally I went with my typical self, and one day I hugged him. He kinda “bro-hugged” me back, which didn’t bother me because let’s face it, I have to start expecting that. However, yesterday, as we were riding the subway, I decided to let him know. I told him “you might wanna expect a lot of affection from me, as you can see, I’m rather a physical person”.

When I said that, he smiled. He smiled and he said he used to be like that as well, but that one day his ex-gf told him it’s not okay for him to do that. I think she’s just insecure. Then, he went on and told me about how he misses the affection two friends can give each other, and then gave me the most heartfelt hug ever.

Ever since, we hug when we see each other, and every time we do, it feels like all the worries are floating away. It’s so awesome to know there’s someone out there in my life who just understands that my affection doesn’t mean more than what it means: *A friend who loves a friend*

Can anyone share some stories about how you moved past the darkest point of your life?,"Hey bros :) Tl;Dr at the bottom 

Im in a shitty place right now, and I don't really feel like I have anyone to turn to &amp; just need a space to vent &amp; maybe hear some kind words.

I've spent the last 5ish months completely isolated from any friendships that Ive developed because of a weed charge thats led me to leave school and stay with my mom and her new husband in a house 2 or so hours from anyone I've known. During this time, my mental &amp; physical health has kind of spiraled. I'm dependant on adderall (which im perscribed) and its gotten to where im taking upwards of 80-100 mg most days. In the past 2 weeks i've ran out of almost 90 20mg pill &amp; have slept from about 11 am to 9 pm. The only time I leave the house is to take drug tests or go to manditory drug classes, &amp; im crying for the first time in months. I feel so helpless. Yesterday I watched youtube for atleast 10 hours, I dont think i spend more than an hour out of bed most days. I dont take care of myself. I've been taking the adderall to 1. Do online classwork 2. Play videogames &amp; 3. Feel like im capabale of doing something besides mindlessly scrolling. I dont even feel like a human being; any depression I feel manifests in numbness. I feel like my whole existance is just finding another distraction. It doesn't hurt in a way where I want to die, I just want to feel some sort of stimulation, &amp; the easiest way to do that is youtube. 

All that to say, i know what I need to do (get a job so im out the house, exercise &amp; eat well, hygiene, practice my instrument) but its just hard getting over the big wall of passivity. I feel ugly and dont want to be seen, I feel incapable of doing what I want to do, &amp; I don't want to do what I need to. 

I feel like I could start taking steps now, but i've been up 24h (not on adderall) and I know these strong feelings wont be there to push me when I wake up. 

TL;DR: Has anyone made progress after a long period of nothing? How did you start moving after being still for so long?

"For the first time I'm dating a girl who is fully supportive of me and my emotions, it's a beautiful and freeing feeling.","I'm 20 and I've dated a few girls. They've ranged from being emotionally caring, but not actually emotionally present to being actively hostile to my emotions and my ""feminine"" hobbies like writing poetry. So I'm not really used to being treated as an emotional equal in relationships.

But two months ago I started seeing this new girl and today I realized why she feels so different and why I'm much happier with her than I was with anyone else. We were at an animal shelter playing with animals and there was this really anxious dog there that had just been abandoned by it's owner. The poor thing was terrified and shaking. It was so sad and anxious and I felt so bad for it that I started crying. Most of my exs would just ignore me or tell me to ""man up"", but my girlfriend just held my hand and told me it was going to be okay.

Advice about sexuality,"Hello broskis,

I honestly didn’t know where to post this, but maybe I can receieve some helpful advice.

Whenever I see a attractive pic of a woman, my mind immediately thinks of sexual thoughts (especially if there’s cleavage). I’ve been trying to cut down on masturbating and porn because I think it’s affecting my thoughts. I didn’t want to go to nofap because I noticed a lot of toxic attitudes and things there (some redpill influence there I think also).

Anyway, coupled with my very low self-esteem, I just feel really ashamed of myself and sometimes angry when I see an attractive woman. Not only because of sexual thoughts but also because I feel like they’re so out of my league.

Add a genetic immune disorder, a shortened lifespan, and a ton of other issues and my life seems insurmountably pointless, worthless and disappointing.

"I don't know if I've ever felt worse about my body, and about Grindr","I've always been kinda small, an average height, but certainly not fit. I've always been sedentary and not very good at sports. So I've always bounced around a pretty thin body type. Over the past year, I've seen my body start to take a turn for the worse. I moved in with my parents for an internship and then got a job in that town, and while living with them, I ate like I used too. Except now I'm much older, and worked longer hours than ever. I'd be grinding to get my work in at the office, often there very late, and had little energy to do much of anything by the time I was done. All the while my parents were making very carb heavy food the way they used to, and eventually my weight began to rise. This past year has been the first time I've been heavier than 145-150 lbs. in years, currently sitting at just over 160. I signed up for a gym but found myself too burnt out, unmotivated, and perplexed at how to exercise properly, to take advantage of my gym. 

Just last fall, I moved back to the city to transfer my college credits towards a degree, and my weight got even higher. Campus has not the best food to be eating while watching weight, and there's very few places to refrigerate meals before lunch. I'm on campus just about all day, and by the time I'm done, I'm also too tired to do much else. This past semester was particularly exhausting, and the coming semesters will be just as busy until I graduate next year. While I want to try and make better choices, I have such a hard time finding the energy to invest in them. Meanwhile, my belly has grown to be noticeable no matter what on my thin frame. I now feel much more self-conscious taking off my shirt, and nowhere near as cute as I used to be. 

This year was also the year I decided to start buzzing my hair down, since my hairline has gotten worse. My thinning and already fine hair means I'm better off just shaving my head than trying to do anything with it. That said, I think the boys have noticed. Nobody really chats with me anymore, or answers my messages. I haven't received dick in a few months now, and it really highlights how dysmorphic I feel about myself. I've begun swiping left on everyone I feel like I have no chance with, which really seems to be hot, gym built, especially well-kept gay and bi men. I've similarly started blocking guys on Grindr based on this too, including dudes who end up never replying. The worst part is knowing that they looked at your profile after you messaged them, and chose to go no further. Maybe it's for the best, as currently I'm not feeling too hot, though I'm at a point where I'm not sure when I'll feel better about myself again.",bropill,1578031136,MisterB3an,4,73,True,2020-01-02

"Bros, I dont know what to do.","Sorry for the long post, I dont have anyone else to talk to about this. :/



Im talking to this girl I really like who has been a very close friend for about 5 years. She's stated her feelings for me after she broke up with her ex, who had barely hugged her twice in their 6 month relationship. Things are going well one minute and ok the next, and it feels like conversations have to be forced sometimes. She's 4,000km away right now and we've been counting the days till her return but with each passing day its been losing the spark. 10 to go.

Ive been testing with a few online businesses and have just started a clothing brand, which has so far failed dramatically and a lot of my friends have ignored me or called it a fail. This girl briefly dated my ""best"" friend who talks a lot of shit about me and is generally a dick (but the only really close friend i have to hang out with and have been with him for three years, regardless of the toxicity).

I've struggled with depression and anxiety in the past and still have them, but less, and i recently feel like an outcast in all of my friends and like no one wants to hang with me. Just got a job interview for the first time in forever so that is good, even though it is minimum wage. 

I dont know what to do bros, should I cut it with this girl and also find new friends? I struggle to make new ones but I might be able to with determination. 

Im afraid to cut my ""best friend"" loose, and ill admit i should probably be better to him as well, hes just been shit so its hard. I feel like the only reason I havent moved away or left this earth is cause of this girl (a really really close friend) and my dreams of blowing up in the clothing business.

Her friends dislike me, because they believe she should be with this other dude who's a fit and successful swimmer, rather than me (overweight, failed at most things ive tried). She still has strong feelings for me, and is the one who has told me about my ""best friend"" talking shit and also about her friends. 

She literally made plans on where we should go, as she knows we both want to escape this town, and shes clearly shown she has strong feelings for me. I do too, but I'm already insecure and although i feel comfortable with this girl, i just dont know. 

Am I an asshole? Should I change? Should I cut myself out of their lives and make everyone else happy? It seems like that.

tl;dr a girl im really close with has admitted feelings and i like her too, however shes far away and the spark feels like its dimming even though its only 10 days to her return. her friends hate me, she really likes me, and my ""best friend"" talks shit behind my back and hates me, but id be a loner without him.

I just wanna take a moment to appreciate this sub. I think it does a great job of combatting typical stereotypes about men as cold and heartless people, instead promoting compassion and taking care of each other. Even the non-dude bros here are provided the same feeling of fellowship and comradery, resulting in a positive and welcoming place for everyone.

"hey bros... I'm stressed, sad, and need to rant.","hey bros so there's been a lot going on in my life and I honestly don't know how to deal with it so I'm just going to dump some stuff here because y'all are so wholesome 

1. i have missed more school since september than I have attended and my parents got a letter from the school district that said I have to stop missing so much school. 
2. because i've missed so much school I'm behind in all of my classes (most of which are really difficult) and i'm so unmotivated to finish all of my work and teach myself
3. my mental health is so rapidly declining. i've been trying new antidepressants since july and none of them have had any effect on me. i'm so dead inside most days i can't get out of bed (which is why i've missed so much school)
4. i feel increasingly suicidal every day that goes by. in october there was a suicide attempt and i vowed to myself to never do it again but it's so fucking hard. i went to a psychiatric facility for about a week but nothing got better. 
5. a few weeks ago my parents found out about my self harm problem and i feel so shitty about it. they're amazing parents and i know they didn't sign up for me being such an issue that they have to worry about. i know that my brother was a problem with all of his mental health crap when he was in high school but i can't shake this feeling that they thought i would be better or something
6. i don't enjoy anything anymore. i have so many hobbies like singing and painting and writing but everything just feels like a chore these days. all i want to do is sleep all the time (which i do. every day when i get home from school i go to sleep and wake up around 1am which results in my homework not getting done)
7. my parents are getting increasingly frustrated with my inability to do things. they don't deserve my bullshit. when they found out about my self harm they locked up all of the sharp objects in the house (i still have razors but they don't know that) but i'm trying not to cut as much. which leads to me doing stupid shit like getting drunk on new years or smoking with a friend, both of which are dumb but i'm trying to channel my urges into something else.
8. my anxiety mixed with ocd is making everything so shitty. i get so anxious around any school related activities and am constantly worried about my friends hating me and i feel like everyone is getting tired of me being sad. so many people have it worse and i'm complaining about petty shit.

sorry about the long ass post i just felt like i should put all of this somewhere. the stress of everything is eating me alive and i just wish i could stop existing.",bropill,1578822002,missnailitall,5,1,True,2020-01-12

Dating dilemma,"So i lurk on a few subreddits, some women dominated ones like trollx, pretty cool subreddit, has revealed to me how shitty most men are and how bad the average woman has it. Well anyway, i've also been reading on dating subreddits a bit too to learn how dating and romance works. Well, well the dilemma here is that to date you need to approach people, either on the streets, hobbies, people you know, at workplace and what not. BUT, the problem is that women do not like getting approached 24/7 by hundreds of men every day both offline and online cuz men are so desperate and thirsty. Also men girlfriendzone women, thought you were friends with him? Turns out he just wanted to get in your pants. Can't even reject the men or else they could get angry and murder or rape you.

Why I Left the Men's Rights Movement,"I originally posted this to menslib, but it got removed for unknown reasons.   

&amp;#x200B;

I first heard of the men's right's movement in high school back in 2012. This was the first time ever hearing of a group that discussed the societal issues that affect men. This was also a time before menslib existed, and when the feminism subreddit explicity banned any discussion of men's issues, even rape/DV of men. As a result, mensrights was the only place to discuss the issues. The video that first introduced me to the men's rights movement was a feminist-led protest against CAFE (Canadian Association for Equality) which featured Big Red incoherently yelling a attendees. I saw this as proof that the feminist movement was anti-men.    

For the next several years, I went through the mensrights subreddit and saw all the feminist-bashing. I, being a naive high schooler, knew nothing about feminism (or women), and believed everything. I was thoroughly convinced that feminism was responsible for the existence of the issues that men face and responsible for silencing any discussion, opposing any legislation that would free men from institutional sexism. I was also introduced to TRP and MGTOW, which were commonly referenced on mensrights. I did spend time on MGTOW, but wasn't a fan of TRP. I never hated women, I just hated that society ignored abusive women and abused men and thought that feminism was the culprit.    

I realize now, as a 22-year old man out of college, that many of the men's issues that exists are because of conservatives and their support for a patriarchal social structure, and that it is the feminists who are talking about solutions to the issues, while MRAs are doing nothing but assigning blame. Looking back, I really wish menslib existed back then. I also wish I had chances to talk to feminists IRL about gender issues, so that I could understand more specifically what feminists believe. Now, I do have criticisms of the feminist movement that I think are legit and constructive (I can elaborate on them if asked). These criticisms are not big enough for me to oppose the feminist movement, but big enough for me to not identify as a feminist (menslib does not require self-identifying as a feminist). However, I have no issue with menslib aligning itself with the feminist movement. I believe that good ideas should be promoted and discussed, without obsessing over labels.   

The lack of spaces for men to discuss their issues without blaming feminism or women is a huge problem, and I think that is part of the reason why so many men such as myself end up in the wrong places and develop misdirected anger and hate. While it is important to call out inaccurate or bigoted information, we must not fall into the trap of vilifying anyone who has been active in MRA groups. Most people who get suckered in to the MRM do not intend to become misogynists. We all make mistakes, and it should be our job to understand and save them before it's too late (kinda like what ContraPoints does), not to destroy them.    

Fundamentally, my stance on men's advocacy is that men (and women) should be allowed to be themselves without the pressures and shackles of masculine gender norms, and not be subjected to sexist laws and court practices (e.g. men receiving longer sentences than women for the same crimes, male rape victims not being recognized under the law). I do think toxic masculinity is a real issue that is, unfortunately, misunderstood as an attack on all masculinity (in my opinion, feminism could do a better job of explaining what toxic masculinity is and isn't).   

It is important for society and parents to not force boys into rigid gender norms, but instead show support for boys who want to, for example, wear dresses, or play with Barbie dolls. It should be acceptable for boys and men to speak up when something is wrong, openly admit to being gay, bi, trans, asexual, etc., and be supported when they are sexually assaulted or raped by anyone. We must tell boys, as we do with girls, that their gender should not limit them from being or doing anything they want. We need more men-centered spaces specifically to discuss these things, as well as shelters for men who are victims/survivors of sexual or partner violence.    

I am glad to have found this group; it is necessary to discuss these issues, and also bring up views and solutions that the mainstream feminist movement might miss.   

I am willing to answer any questions you might have.",bropill,1578927451,savethebros,71,1,True,2020-01-13
A quick message to my bros,"So I was browsing this sub and I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bropill/comments/eo1p20/dating_dilemma/), and it got me thinking about dating, relationships etc. and how they relate to masculinity. A lot of what we see in media and advertising really tries to push the idea that being a man necessarily involves sex, lots of it, and always from a cis-het perspective. This is problematic for lots of reasons, it perpetuates the idea that sex exists for men, to be done to women and only women, it objectifies sex and all those involved, making it little more than a status symbol, and a whole host of other things. The thing I'd like to talk about though is the fact that it defines masculinity as one's ability to be with someone, and if one is not with someone, they aren't a man. It defines masculinity by something that is fundamentally outside of, and distinct from, the person themselves. I just wanted to take a sec to remind all you kings that it's OK to be single, that a relationship does not define you. With the same sort of sentiment that women don't need a man, men don't necessarily need a woman, and that's OK. By all means, don't stop dating or anything, but don't let that desire for a relationship define you, you're your own person, with your own needs, and you are so much more than just who you sleep with.

(P.S. Special shoutout to my LGBT bros, your sexuality, identity, and the relationships you choose to have do not impact your masculinity or status as a bro, just as they do not define you.

I started high school this year, and with that became a lot of stress. I never did well in school, and I had a habit of being with awful people. I’m glad to say I’m doing absolutely amazing in all of my classes.

There’s this one person in particular, this guy was not and IS not a bro. I met him in the 6th grade, and we were really good friends. 

During that time, I realized that I’m gay. I started dating a guy and we were extremely happy together. We broke up this year after two years but it was on good terms and we’re still good friends.

This one guy, he would constantly bash me for being gay. He would take every opportunity to make fun of me. When people would do it in a group, he wouldn’t help, he’d just join in. 

I comforted him when something wrong went in his life, and this is how he repaid me. 

In a way, he’s a Nazi too, politically wise and such. He’s a literal white supremacist.

But, earlier this school year, I blocked him on everything and I quit talking to him. I had only a few people to go to but that was it.

One day, one of my absolute now best friends who I stopped hanging out with and started hanging out with the Nazi, started hanging out with me.

I think I lost a friend of 18 yrs because toxic masculinity,"We grew up together in a small (800 ppl) conservative town. Looking back nobody has it *that* good but comparatively he had a much harder family life. His dad was a straight up bully, I remember hanging out at his house when we were kids and the vibe would instantly shift as soon as his dad got home. His dad always had some kind of criticism and I know he was sometimes violent though I never personally witnessed it. Despite this my friend managed to cultivate a genuine compassion for other people and I've always respected that. He didn't ever show it but its one of those things that you knew were just under the surface. I knew I was gay pretty young, though I didn't come out until I was 19 and way the fuck away from that place, and even then it took a lot. My friend always sort of knew and though he occasionally made me feel humiliated for it (there's one time in high school gym class that I can never forget but it's not super important right now) I was maybe too willing to look past it because people treat each other like shit in general, it's sadly what a lot of us learn as kids and isn't always indicative of how we really feel. Plus every now and then he would say he was comfortable with gay people and thought they should be treated like humans and that meant a lot to me. I literally didn't meet an openly gay person until I was 18 and I was sleeping around before that. I thought being secretive and quietly living with all of my shame was just a part of being gay and knowing that somebody didn't think I was a total freak even though they sometimes habitually treated me that way probably saved my life. It's safe to say I set the friendship bar pretty low but at the time I didn't feel like there was a lot of other options. There was roughly 100 kids in my school, grade 6-12. Looking back I realize there's other people I could have reached out to but to middle-high school me the risk v.s possible outcome wasn't worth it. I didn't really feel like there was a potential for me to feel loved anyway so coming out felt pointless and scary. I guess for this reason semi-abusive friendships suited me just fine then. 

Now here we are five years later in 2019. He's experienced more loss than any human should and has been struggling on and of with drug addiction since high school. I'm on the other side of a serious ho phase and am a lot more comfortable with myself than I used to be, though I still freeze up or get inwardly angry when people talk about gender and sexuality. I also disassociate a lot and find it hard to keep up conversations because I'm anxious. I might be autistic, I don't know. I'm pretty lucky in the grand scheme of things. We both smoke a lot of weed. There's so much that I genuinely need to talk about and society says that men aren't supposed to talk about feelings. Sometimes I try to allude towards the potential of that conversation and the vibe gets almost scary, it's hard to describe. My friend has learned the hard way to channel his feeling into judgments of other people. To him it's not that he's angry at the world, it's that the world has been terrible to him. It has, so you can't blame him for thinking that, but it's like that for everything. Watching my friend lose his ability to connect with his feelings has been hard enough, but when I'm around him that energy is pointed my way. It's a constant stream of criticisms and insults ""jokingly"" directed at me. Being around him now just makes me angry and sad. If that compassion is still there it's buried deep under contempt and I can't see it anymore. As if that wasn't enough there was a time when he wanted to be more than friends. It was never really spoken but it was definitely there. One night later on we were shitfaced and I forget the context but he said I wanted to have sex with him and I immediately got internally defensive and said something like you know I've already had like a thousand chances for that and didn't take them, and he said yeah true. Part of me wanted that too but I felt I could never trust him. Lately I think he's gone around telling all of our mutual friends I'm some sort of crazy sexual deviant. I feel so betrayed. You can only deal with so much without ever talking about how it makes you feel. Society doesn't just not give guys the tools to talk about feelings, it actively humiliates us for trying. We humiliate each other. It's literally killing us.",bropill,1576260775,manonaraft,6,1,True,2019-12-13

Remembrance and Solidarity,"Hey bros, it's International Trans Remembrance Day. 

As a Cisbro I can't lead any sort of conversation about the appalling hate crimes and murders that our trans siblings suffer—particularly trans people of colour, who make up the majority of the hundreds murdered yearly in the U.S. and other states around the world. For that, I'll link some resources below.

All I want to say is that: to the trans bros, bras, and brxs of all gender identities in this community—you're loved. We need you. You're our family. You always will be. 

To my other cisters and ally-bros: it's our fundamental duty to stand up for one another. Not just as bros, but as human beings. Solidarity forever.

Traditionally masculine men are not inherently toxic.,"Toxic masculinity is a very hard thing to navigate. It puts restrictions on how many men experience themselves as physical and emotional beings.

This being said, it's important to remember that traditional forms of masculinity are not inherently toxic.

Society needs masculinity just like it needs a balance of all things.

Masculinity doesn't need to be tyrannical or dominating. We need our mascbros.

Masculinity is the person that stands up for those who cannot do so themselves. It's the dad that teaches his children how to be assertive and direct while still respecting boundaries. It's the student willing to confront the bully and protect them by any means necessary.

Masculinity is tied with power, and this power does not always have to used for domination. Just as a person fighting to protect their family from a threat is powerful, so is their ability to admit when they feel upset or vulnerable. Traditional masculinity is able to set emotion aside to get things done more effectively in the moment, but it is also just as much the ability to feel these emotions and let them exist when they come about.

We need masculinity. We need it's stern wisdom, it's protection, and it's vulnerability all the same.",bropill,1574375313,CummyCummyCummy,13,1,True,2019-11-21

A man must try on many hats before leaning to polish his bald spot: Dating app wisdom from a bro with alopecia,"**TL;DR: A baldbro of mine told me an amazing story of how he had to fail and hurt before he learned to be his true broself and inspired me to come out as bisexual.** 

Hey Bros, I wanna share a really interesting conversation I had with one of my bros, 

Some months ago I was hanging out with a bro of mine who has alopecia and had recently shaved his head because his alopecia had hit lvl 99.  We got around to talking about dating apps and his various failures and successes. I asked my bro, ""my dude, can I ask you an uncomfortable question?"" and he said ""yeah, anything lolsleepyboi"". 

So I asked him. ""Baldbro, do you ever worry about your alopecia when you go on first dates?"". Baldbro smiled said he had coined this little phrase for himself. He said, ""a man must try on many hats before he learns to polish his bald spot."" Of course, baldbro meant this figuratively and literally. See, Baldbro started using Hinge a few years ago and went through a period where he was trying on all these different personality styles, dress, flirting games, ect. and none of it was working for him. He even dabbled in redpill, but none of this was making him happy. Eventually, he was ready to give up. 

That was, until he decided to go bald. See, before he decided to shave his head and go totally bald, his hair was his biggest insecurity, and he kept trying to compensate for it and it was obvious to all. In fact, he was so worried about his hair that he had missed the big benefit of dating apps: that you can chat with all these different people and filter everyone out until you click with somebody. He was too worried about his own insecurities to actually seek out people he could see as a potential partner. 

During that conversation he said something like, ""the thing is, 'just be yourself' is a trope. Like, nobody wakes up and decides 'today I'm going to be myself' and suddenly all your depression and anxiety goes away. You gotta feel the hurt of not being yourself first. You gotta see how shitty being fake is and how lonely it makes you feel before you figure out what 'be yourself' actually means and sometimes, you gotta do it over and over until you're too exhausted to be anybody but just yourself."" 

For baldbro, that meant that he had to become so sick of feeling insecure about his hair that he was ready to go bald and rock the sexy baldbro look, which he used to scoff at. In truth though, he was so down on himself, it was the only option he had left. There was nothing he could do to make himself feel better about his hair until he simply got rid of it. 

I think the point that baldbro was making is that, while its really cool to be secure with the peculiarities of your body, your personality and everything else, the harsh truth is that it's really hard, especially for bros, to get to that point where you can so open about your flaws that they aren't a barrier, or better yet, actually start to work for you.  Once you get on the other side though, you realize that owning your insecurities is way more enjoyable than hiding them from people. The point is though, is that 'be yourself' is overused. 

Baldbro has been in a relationship with a young woman for about half a year now. She's got it all - super smart, super funny, very pretty and also throws the fuck down for smashbros 64. 

So to all those bros who are on a journey of self discovery or romance, take this away from baldbro: Take a moment, take a deep breath and realize that your path to self discovery is probably going to hurt. It's probably going to hurt a lot. Be ready for that failure and heartache and pain and realize that once you start feeling tired... once you start feeling low, it means you're maturing and growing. 

For some bros, that might mean you're a teenage bro trying to make friends in high school, and maybe you're just not going to find your niche until you go to college. For other bros, it might mean that you're so sick of smoking cigarettes or using drugs or pornography that you're truly ready to quit. For other bros, it might mean that you're so sick of being overweight that you're too exhausted not to get fit. 

After that conversation, I realized I was so sick of hiding my bisexuality that I said ""fuck it, I'm going to come out and take the consequences that come with it. So I came out to all my friends and family. And no doubt, I learned that a number of former bros harbored some very unchill bigotry. But, like baldbro, I ended up much for the better. Thanks baldbro.

In the midst of a burnout in school and I don't know what to do,"Hi bros, I've never posted here before but I've always admired the community. I think it's super dope that a supportive community is here for bros to be among bros. I could use a little advice right now, if anyone has experienced something similar, as this semester has hit me pretty hard.

I just started a part time job porting at a local music venue. I've done this before so it's not foreign to me by any means. Last night wasn't even very late, or at least, as late as tonight will be, but trying to work on my assignments has been a real struggle today. I've felt this exhaustion hanging over me recently that felt particularly bad today. I feel mentally spent, and to some extent physically as well. I'm actually kind of dreading my shift tonight even though I definitely need the money right now. Much of this dread is knowing how I won't have much time to continue working on my assignments tonight.

I have a huge English essay comparing two pieces we've covered that read in class that is due on Tuesday. As little as five or more errors can give me a failing grade. I really ought to revise my deliberative speech outline for class on Tuesday, as well, ahead of completing my final draft for Friday. I'm to edit an article by my classmate and one assigned to me to ensure they're accurate and conform to appropriate style ahead of the start of Wednesday's class. Before Monday, I need to prepare for a job interview with two examples of word I'd do and an example of work I've already done. This job is a contract with part time hours that really gives me some great experience in my field, so it would be really preferable to the job I just took on, even though it's definitely serving more hours. But really, all of this is just piling up, and making a really tight deadline for a lot of work and it seems kind of awful.

Earlier this month I went back for a Thanksgiving ahead of the actual date, because nobody would be available for it. I had some homework to do, too, among other housekeeping duties at my parent's place. I wasn't very well focused at all, in fact, I didn't get a whole lot done, was not as helpful as usual around the event, and felt very unsociable. This burnout is affecting the way I help out my family and it makes me feel like a real piece of shit. I honestly don't know if anyone else is feeling a similar burnout to me, and sometimes wonder if it's due in part to an untreated mental illness. It might be worth checking into, but really I just want a night of sleep to make me feel rested, when sleep actually works out that is. Sometimes I have a hard time falling asleep, whereas other times I wake up entirely too early and can't sleep anymore, even though I really ought to.

So yeah, I don't know where to go from here. Forward is the only option I really have right now as I need to stay on top of things, at least until our shitty half reading week. I *need* to stay productive, but I don't know how to care for myself outside of all the things I really need to do. Sometimes I get this vague pressure behind my eyes that remind me of the feeling that you could just cry, and I might do that soon, but maybe not before I have to work a shift all night.",bropill,1571530801,MisterB3an,2,11,True,2019-10-19
You don't need to overcompensate for being tender by being extra masculine,"I just found this sub and LOVE the male positivity and encouragement for us to be honest about our emotions and needs, but I feel like a common theme here (and in the real world too) is that many men can only open up and make themselves vulnerable while overcompensating and becoming *extra* masculine in image.

For example, saying ""bro"" all the time- idk about you all but I don't have a single male friend who says ""bro"" anymore, but a lot of these posts are like ""I love you bro"" or ""you're beautiful bro"" which is fine and great, but to me if you don't usually say ""bro"" yet you feel you need to when saying something vulnerable and honest like that, then you're still not fully expressing and exploring those feelings, and you're using ""bro"" as a way to say ""see, I'm not gay"" or ""see I'm still a real man"".

I guess on one had it's good to inject masculine stereotypes (calling other men ""bro"") with more emotional honesty and vulnerability (expressing love), but I think it's also incredibly valuable to exercise tenderness and vulnerability free of forced masculinity.

It goes beyond just saying ""bro"" of course, but that's what got me thinking about this.  I definitely feel this pressure to prove that I'm a ""manly man"" despite- and especially while- being emotionally open and vulnerable...anyone else?",bropill,1571541171,paintthedaytimeblack,12,82,True,2019-10-19
"It's strange being a man, bros","I'm a man with weird mental health issues that make it difficult for me to be comfortable with myself and my gender especially. It is basically a set of anxieties that's very harmful to my self-identity. It always feels like there's something more I should be doing to be at ease with myself, but I don't really know what. It's distressing and I'm tired of it. I'm not trans: I'm very much a man. It just feels like my definition of what it is to be a man is very different from that of a lot of people, and I'm tired of the remarks on my way to express my gender. 

The slightest deviations from traditional masculinity will get you remarks from random people you don't know. I learned that there was a masculine way to place in your hand and apparently it's not what I was doing. Kind of bullshit: how do you emote without using these things that they tell us can't be masculine?

"Ex-incel/""nice guy"" here needing some advice from my fellow bros.","Hey guys, not sure if this is the right place to post this but I love this community and am searching for guidance from fellow bros. I struggle with being vulnerable sometimes so I'll do my best here.

Up until about a year ago I was an incel. Not in the super extreme advocate-for-violence way, but in terms of being really angry and resentful towards women I felt dejected by. 

To make a very long story short I've been taking responsibility for my actions and have gotten very far away from this mindset. I left a school I was miserable at and am now going to therapy regularly, dressing better, eating better, etc.

I'm making this post because although the misogyny I once held has been shaken, I still hold alot of internal shame about my lack of experience in relationships and sex.

For the most part I feel good about myself. I'm pretty extroverted and I have a good job and am close to getting 2 degrees in two fields I love. I'm pretty traditionally masculine, and thankfully I've done alot of work to shake of the toxic elements of masculinity I was holding onto.

With this being said, I can't help but to feel like I'm ""less of a man"" because of my lack of experience in dating and sex. I know objectively that it really doesn't matter, but when most of your friends have those experiences it's kind of hard not to feel kinda bad about not having any for yourself.

The entitlement and resentment of people I developed while I was an incel is gone, but the frustration still exists. Everything else is on the right track but I can't shake the shame about my lack of sex/dating experience and I constantly worry about how others will judge me for this.

"Bros, arm-in-arm","In Victorian England and America, it was normal for men to walk arm-in-arm. The idea that male relationships aren't physically affectionate is a modern contrivance. It's also partially an evolution of anti-gay sentiment. Steven Fry does a bit about how the prosecution of Oscar Wilde helped start its perception as ""too feminine.""

Part of the suicide epidemic in men is definitely this dearth of social support. 

I'm massively simplifying but, in some way, persecution of LGBT+ people 120 years ago is killing straight cis men, to say nothing of the countless it directly hurt. Society is an ecosystem and the chaining of one hurts us all.

How To Tell A Bro That You Appreciate Him,"Hi bros - I'm [14M] a new bro to this sub and happy to be here.

I have Asperger's and I struggle a LOT with socializing. But I found some bros who actually get me.

We're in the same class and talk online as well outside of school. He's not my only bro but he is a great one.

But as I said I am a very awkward bro when it comes to socializing. I use the wrong tone, bad body language, incorrect phrases, don't use eye contact etc. so I get nervous about giving off the wrong vibe. 

So I'm thinking to ask - what is the best way to tell a bro that you value the friendship you bros have? He's a good bro and wouldn't take it badly, I just often end up giving off the wrong 'vibe' if that's the way to put it. I don't want to give any bros a confusing message or any issues.

I’ve been waiting a long time for this, but now that it’s happening I’m having cold feet, anxiety and want to back out, knowing that I will still want this surgery later.

Despite what social media says, some of us have doubts every once in a while. And even if I’m changing to the body I’ve always wanted, it is still scary with such a big and permanent change.

And surgery is scary. I hate blood and gore, and willingly inflicting it on my body feels very wrong.

I know it’s the right decision. But I could really use a pep talk to push through all this anxiety!",bropill,1569231859,coconuts_and_lime,5,3,True,2019-09-23
about insecurities and moving on,"Hello people. Alt account because obvious reasons. Sorry for the story time but i could use, at least, an honest opinion, im kinda lost and hurt and i sincerely don't know where to go or who to turn to. Some background: I (30M) am/was seeing with someone, let's call her L(35F). We met through tinder, we saw eachother a couple of times, then we slept together, completely casual and no commitment adn we did so several times again on the span of last august and september. I was also seeing some other women at the time, but i stopped seeing them, for varying reasons, unrelated to L. Idillyc so far, amirite? Here's where shit goes sideways.

  
A couple of weeks ago, we went on a date to a nearby brewery run by two acquaintances from high school, up till then we only met in her house or mine, (i didn't know it was theirs) but i knew she was a regular and they knew her. Understatement of the year. she was a friend or well known acquaintance of the owners and basically everyone else who visited the shop that night, im talking 20 plus people. We come to my place, sex is kinda unpersonal and disconnected on my end. Up till then sex was possibly the best i ever had, not in the frat boy porn movie kinda way but rather it was always deep and meaningful, i felt like we really connected and blablah sensitive shit, sorry. She told me she felt it the same too, btw. Next morning, we wake up, and she goes to work, we say goodbye, she walks away always looking back, i go home and get to work and it hits me. **I don't want her to go**.

So a bit more background on her and me. She's a an actress and acrobat and traveled all of europe, south and central america with ther troupee, currently works as a social worker/gym teacher. She's bisexual from young age, she had a ton of sexual experiences of basically every kind under the sun, she's strong, sweet, kind, charismatic, intelligent, etc.  (in Bogota, she sneaked throug a riot in the city and conned her way into meeting manu chao, at his concert with her and journalist friends sothey can get an interview, ffs). here's what i found out about her that night at the brewery as well, she slept with my (female) best friend with whom i had a crush when i was 18 (i lost contact with her a long time tho), right around the time i was crushing on her. She knows my music teacher (male) even though she denied it when i asked her if she did. She's met and have sex with amazing and  very talented, handsome and successful people around the world and in our city.  And some other stuff i wont get into cause this is already getting long and pathetic enough.

Now me. Im 30, far less experienced in everything, i travelled a bit but not as much, not antisocial but shy and have a hard time making friends or meeting new people. im also bi but only found out recently and had very little experience with two other men. Other than that, i spent my 20s in two long serious relationships of four years. during that time i really thought i had left my insecurities and my akwardness behind, i though i was  confident and mature. But here's the thing when she left that morning, it's been two weeks since, and we haven't seen yet but every day, every morning when i wake up, everynight when i go to sleep, at work, at class, at the gym, at rehearsal with the band. im thinking about her. **But here's the worst part in case this wasn't incely enough: Im not just missing her because i wanna be with her again (which i do) but im also torturing myself about who is she with when not with me. Or who hsa she slept with of my acquaintances in the past or present.** I know i shouldn't, i know it's not my fucking business, i know it matter not who she's seeing with or what's she doing or what she did or who did it with. And the truth is  that i don't really want a exclusive relationship with her (she doesn't want one either). I liked it casual, i liked when we had agreat time and loved each other for a day or anight and then we were off to live our lives. Even though deep down i always knew it was going to hend badly for me (i told her as much). But when i saw her in perspective that night at the brewery, things changed. When we were just us in isolation she was a mountain. She was a colossus, she was larger than life. But then i saw her with other people, some of them having the same relationship with her than i had, some of them just has big as i am, some of them just as big as she was and i guess she's not a colossus anymore, she's not a mountain. Im just small. Im just a blip in her radar, a footnote in her story. 

I don't know what to do. 15 years ago i fell in love for the first time. and the girl was extremely cruel and manipulative and it hurt like hell. But also i felt the same insecurities and pain and self destructive thoughts i feel now. I was dangerously close to becoming what is now called an incel (at the time the friendzone wasn't even a thing). And honestly F\*ck that. It took me 13 long ass years to heal and rebuild myself into something close to what i'd like to be and i really don't want to go back to that. But i want to keep seeing her, her smile, her eyes, her voice, listening her tell me stories of her travels, or explaining me new things. After sex, she asks me to tell her stories or tales but i have nothing of my own, so i adapt something from videogames (the dark souls intro was her favorite) and we have fun and connect. I really wanna keep seeing her. But i refuse to become a hateful, spiteful, petty asshole again, angry with the world that i don't get my way or believe that she's being unfair for living her life unrelated to me.

anyway, if you made it this far, thanks. That's my story. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Sorry it was so long but i really wanted to get that out of my chest.

I’ve been feeling lonely and idk what to do about it.,"I recently started college and just went through that almost obligatory break up with your highschool girlfriend. I didn’t think it had really had an effect on me until yesterday when I realized how lonely I felt.
I hadn’t felt it because i have been hanging out with this group of friends and specifically this one girl whom I have developed feelings for, even though those same feelings are not reciprocated(in a she is as loving with everyone as she is with me). The problem is she’s somewhat of a cuddle hoe so some nights she might lay with me or she might lay with someone else, which is what happened last night.
The problem is, while yes there was some jealousy, it made me realize how lonely I truly am. I looked around and saw everyone looked like they had a person they were connected to and it didn’t feel like i did. This could have just been in my head because I know everyone there cares for me, but still.

Long story short bros, after breaking up with my girlfriend and getting a dumb crush on another girl, I realized how lonely I feel even around my friends, and I realized it’s hard for me to talk to people about this sort of thing.

I had no idea being a dude-bro could be so hard,"I have very recently gone from living as female to living as male. The transition has gone very quickly and smoothly, and some of the aspects of my new life has hit me hard.

I had no idea how hard it can be being a man, regardless of trans status. Growing up on the other side, and on top of everything raised by women only, I was always told men has it so much easier. I think society puts big expectations on men for that very reason.

Women face a lot of bad stuff, and I’m not saying either gender has it easy. But I’d like to take a moment to appreciate all my dude-bro’s out there, facing society’s high standards of masculinity daily. 

I hope to learn to navigate this life as the man I’ve been all along. It’s not an easy one, but at least it is the right one.",bropill,1567635242,coconuts_and_lime,18,148,True,2019-09-04

But my entire life I’ve always been terrible at cooking. Everyone’s always joked about my inability to do it, and made fun of me in the process. My parents have always laughed at me for not being able to slice bread evenly, and I told my Mum that I wanted to learn over text but she ignored me. 

We don’t have enough ingredients to make anything that I want. And on top of that I feel like I shouldn’t learn because it’s not a “masculine” activity. I don’t want to just make meats and entrees, I want to bake cakes and stuff too. But I feel like wanting to bake and cook makes me not “a real man.”

On the Dayton Shooting and Jordan Cofer,"Hey bros,

This post is going to be somber in comparison to the tone of this sub but recently in Dayton there was a shooting which I'm sure most people have heard about already.

On the other hand, there is something which I am sure most people *haven't* heard about, and that is this: the sibling of the shooter who passed away was a trans man and chose to go by the name 'Jordan'. You can read more about this [here](https://www.advocate.com/news/2019/8/07/report-sibling-killed-dayton-shooting-was-trans-man-jordan-cofer).

I would humbly request that you be a bro to our fallen bro, Jordan Cofer, and honor him by using his chosen name and validating his gender identity by referring to him with his preferred pronouns. This is the least we can do in remembrance of Jordan.

And — if you could — would you help out other bros and sibs by making them aware of this when it comes up?

"The pace slows down quickly when dating, is that normal?","I don't know bro, I just feel like these girls are losing interest waay quicker than I can handle. 

Been using tinder for a few weeks now, now I was paired with that sweetie, she even messaged me first which was cute, especially since I had a minor breakdown (met with other super nice person that day and she rejected me shortly after, I can't blame her, I did one dumb thing). 

Later I got her snap, I removed Tinder, it's been fine for the first few days but then she would progressively become less involved. She's saying she has little time now, I believe her, it was okay when she would reply hours after I sent her a message.

The thing is - yesterday she left me on read. After a few hours I texted her, feeling super bad because it's kind of humiliating, it wasn't my turn.
And now she did it again. Now I'm trying to convince myself that I shouldn't be interested in her, I think she's giving me a hint and that's fine, I can't force her to like me by me being obnoxious. 

And we're going on a date in a week, what if she doesn't message me today? Should I confront her tomorrow by asking her if she still wants to meet with me?

Is that normal that people just lose interest after few days of texting? I actually find myself a great speaker, you can take this for granted.",bropill,1565343741,ddplf,0,1,True,2019-08-09
