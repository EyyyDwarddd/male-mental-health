"Men in leadership positions, how did you get there?","Hi!

I am finishing up my college degree in Digital Marketing, and I've noticed in group projects, I naturally tend to fill the ""group leader"" roll, although it's something kind of uncomfortable for me. I've noticed through quarters, I'm becoming more and more direct with expectations when it comes to assignments and what grades I expect ( I don't let things slide if it puts me/team members at risk).

I'm not sure if I'm doing things right, I know I lack confidence and want to be kind, but I'm not sure if that will work in the real world.

I've also had a girl instantly lose interest in me when she found out my job paid for my lifestyle. They housed me in a waterfront property, paid for my wardrobe, I went to events and I had a company car to use as my own, but I was probably making less money than a qualified builder and after the year long project was done, I was moving back to the suburbs.

How can I deal better with leaving for a business trip?,"Hey guys, I have been trying but failing to deal with this problem for many years now, and I thought maybe I could ask you for advice. Every time I have a business trip or something similar coming up, where I have to leave my wife behind, I panic almost the entire week before.

I think a lot about how I am going to miss my wife, and I feel like I am almost constantly on the edge of panicking. Usually once I am actually there is dissipates a little, though sometimes after a hard or long day I find that I really nice the closeness and the ability to vent, which is just not as great over the phone. 

I feel like a wuss for being so emotional and scared over this, but I can't really seem to help it. I've tried meditating a little, doing some excercise, etc. but they are all very temporary fixes.

"Guys who almost made it professionally in a sport. How did it feel then, how did you cope and how do yoh feel now?","There's very few examples in life i can think of, where the roads diverge can so much in a person's life. On one hand if you dont make it you become an average civilian. On the other hand if you do, multimillion dollar contracts, fame, hot women, veneration from the masses, rubbing shoulders with the best everyday and everything else 6 year old boys dreams of is a reality to you. Not making it but getting very close has certainly got to be some kind of unique mental hell of ""what could have been"", especially if you did everything right and its something out of your control like an injury. Although not being good enough, or being lazy also probably hurts pretty bad.



For the vast majority of people pro sports is always an afterthought, since it just doesn't pay that well in most countries and most parents push their kids away from it. So their isn't that much scientific or anecdotal literature out there of how people have dealt with this. I only found one guy by accident named Inky Johnson, who was garunteed a spot in the NFL only a few games away from making it, when he got a career ending injury. It was a very humbling story of how someone who wanted to make it out of poverty in the ghettos and dedicated his life to the sport lost it all in an instant. He turned to religion and God to cope with it.

"Fellow guys, I've hit absolute rock bottom... I'm turning 30 in a few months - how do I turn my life around?","So guys, I've been thinking about making this thread for some time now. I feel like a failure as I'm about to turn 30 this year even before summer and feel like I wasted the majority of my youth and 20s:

I have basically no friends, the few ones I've seen every few months and the one mate I did something together with maybe once a month have died down since all of this Covid bullshit. I'm pretty bad to make new friends outside of my usual connections like school or work. Heck, even if I somehow make connections to people they will die down as soon as the school or work ends. I spent the majority of my 20s and still spend the majority of my free time with my PC, used to game a lot but after starting to work and being constantly tired I rarely game anymore, now I rather watch youtube or netflix or something other useless to keep me occupied...

The thought of getting together with a girl is pretty much absurd at this point to me. I have no real experiences with the other gender and basically stopped even thinking about it, the last time I fell in love with a friend didn't end well. I just changed my job to a new workplace the start of this year which seemed to be a stepup from my old, sometimes really annoying job but overall there emerged some absolute NO-GO's for me that makes continuing the job hard, very hard. If I had known about those things beforehand I would have never signed in the first place tbh. Going back to my old job might be an option but as I've heard from a colleague there's a few things that changed and it may not even be possible and even then, it would be pretty different. 

I wanted this year to be the one where I finally make things change but right now it seems like everything failed and I feel trapped in this misery.",AskMen,1612808211,Tungd1l,28,1,True,2021-02-08

I really liked Adam Sandler character in Uncut Gems, even though he's not the type you'd normally want to idolize, I like how he goes around and does his own thing, same with Punch Drunk Love. Kind of a Holden Caulfield vibe

The smell down there was different. Not bad. But different. She messaged me she was moving out because she wasn‚Äôt good enough for me before lunch. Since then I found out she cheated. It‚Äôs a mess. I only know because she gave my son a old phone and he happened to log into that day. And she left her messenger open. When he put his SIM card in hundreds of messages loaded. Several men.

How do you know when it is time?,"So I am a junior in college right now and have been with my girlfriend since the summer I started college (2 and a half years). 

This is my first major relationship, so I went in blindly not really knowing what to expect. We got really close over the first few months and it resulted in me spending all of my available time with her and pretty much ignoring my friends and my family. That ended up leading to a really controlling dynamic where we would shame/guilt each other into spending time together (i.e. ‚ÄúI drove back this weekend just so I could see you and now you‚Äôre going to have a sleepover at your friends?!?‚Äù type of stuff). That was our dynamic for around the first year or so until we finally got the hang of it. 

She has broken up with me multiple times throughout our relationship. Sometimes over petty stuff and the two main times there were justified reasons, mainly resulting from what was discussed above. The most recent time she broke up with me was over this summer after I had called her out in a groupchat that we have with some friends from high school. I was miserable the first week or so but I eventually collected myself and was working through it all the while not talking to her much. 

I then had I guess what you would call a relapse and called her begging her to get back together with me and that I would do all of these things to make the relationship work again. She was hesitant and she then called me a few days later telling me that she would get back together with me. I was extremely happy but as time went on things just haven‚Äôt really felt the same since we have gotten back together. 

I used to not think about other girls or want to be with others. But now, I look at other girls that I find attractive and I wonder what it would be like to be with them. I‚Äôve gotten to the point now where I am almost numb to our relationship and I personally don‚Äôt see a long term future together. I really like her as a person, but this is the only person that I have ever been with, so I don‚Äôt know if it is time to call it quits or if I should keep sticking it out hoping things will get better.",AskMen,1611465566,hall1816,9,1,True,2021-01-23

How do you balance a remote career with looking after your parents financially/emotionally?,"One of my grandparents has recently been diagnosed with cancer and watching my parents react to this has given me quite a shock to my system. 

You go through your life thinking your parents are invincible but as I reach my late 20's, and as my only remaining grandparent has been admitted to hospital, I realise that my parents have both experienced the loss of a parent at least once each and both stayed close to extended family throughout their lives. 

I always aim to be the most supportive version of myself, both now and in the (very) hopefully far future, when I will be in a similar position as my parents. 

However, I'm not sure about following my current career path as it takes me further from home and potentially makes me not able to financially support my family, even though I would be doing what I love, and would miss out on precious moments together.

How do you guys deal with following your passions while remaining true to your families?

I think i have maladaptive daydreaming - meaning i just daydream too much (its not very extereme, i just need to be more mindful and self aware) but im not sure what is the normal amount, so that why, so she just keeps popping in head, all the fucking time, like its been 3 years for fuck sakes, what the fuck, i cant go a day seeing her image in my head, tf fuck is wrong with my brain, is it really 'love' - which again i have no idea wtf it is or I just need to distract myself more to break my brains habit

every fucking moring withing 5min somehow she comes to my brain, its fucking frustating now

back story - its been 3years since our breakup, she called a few months ago just to chat yeah, after a few time it got me reminiscing, even tho we hurt each pretty hard, egos and respect were straight up assualted, we talked about it, and how we were teenagers that time, both have grown up, she was also was being so difficult to talk to it got me more mad, I wanted to grow up, deal with things with pateince and maturance, but last time again she pissed me off cause she was being too difficult to talk. Now that im going on this past trip, i realised what problem even she had to face - so again im not sure am I being mature and compassionate for real or is it just my way find road back to her.

How do you deal with sexual/relationship envy towards partners/future partners?,"I came out of a 2 year relationship not too long ago, we were never on bad terms are we are slowly getting closer again and considering trying again now that we are both in a better space.

The problem for me, is in that time I've dated no one else, slept with no one else or anything at all. She hasn't slept with anyone but she has made out with loads of guys and dated a couple.

While her actions do not bother me, it sort of reflects my inability to easily attract a partner and partially I think that will always nag at me if we try again, and obviously that would jeopardize our success.

I've tried tinder, and going out etc. I havent really enjoyed going out and drinking that much because I have some intent and I'm not really going to just have a good time, no matter how much I drink I'm always sort of neurotic? And I go through a fuckload of mental backflips for behavior that would usually be natural instinctual. Really I just want to meet my sexual needs, I don't have an interest in dating, but the fact I kind do either is kind of depressing when I think about it in relation to my ex.

It's far more painful to keep forcing my self into situations where I'm not greatly in my element and I think I should just accept the way I am, but how do you do that?

I'm not really bothered by it greatly, I just don't want to get to back with my ex and be permanently mildly self loathing, or risk losing that opportunity to try again cause I take tool long trying to kiss a random",AskMen,1608871575,Iseith31,18,1,True,2020-12-24

How do you maintain friends with someone who strongly disagree with politically?,"Preface: I am in NO WAY trying to start a political debate. I know just asking this question veers on breaking the rules of this sub. I'm just looking for some honest advice. 

Throughout my life, I've supported ideologies all over the political spectrum. Over the last decade or so however, I've pretty much settled in to my world views. I look at the main 2 parties, look at the pros and cons of both, and vote for whichever party has the most ""yes"" boxes that I support. I just vote Democrat now. I like the ideas even though I don't particularly like the candidate. I'm also not against conservatism. I don't agree with the majority of those ideologies but I'm mature enough to know that some people just think and view the world differently. I have a few friends who are very ""redneck"" conservative. Stereotypes and all. Racist remarks, hate speech of liberals, a little homophobic, super pro gun, ect. This never really bothered me. We never really got too deep into politics and just choose to base our friendships based on other common interest. But this time, it's feels...different. if you haven't guessed by now, I'm an American. My friends are huge Trump supporters. And I just can't take it anymore. The racism, the hateful rhetoric, the ignorance and rejection of science. I just can't see past it anymore. I hate it. I don't hate them, but I don't know if can force it anymore. I'm ashamed to have had the capacity to brush off the horrible things they say about people. Idk what to do. I've lost friends before but it was never my doing. I just cannot have this kind of anger and hatred in my life.",AskMen,1607570894,13th_Floor_Please,57,1,True,2020-12-09

"If a girl asks for your number and you politely decline, but she keeps hitting on you, what do you do?","I (26F) have been going to the gym a lot since it is the only way I can keep my sanity right now (i'm a nurse). I've seen this guy regularly at the gym around the times I am there. He recently struck up a conversation with me about how he moved here recently from Washington and basically told me summary of life story. I'd like to think of myself as a nice person, so I just casually chatted with him since we have some stuff in common and gave him some recommendations since he is new to the area. He asked me for my number and I politely declined and told him I have a boyfriend. About a week later, he came up to me again to chat. I told him I commute to the hospital I work at and he offered to let me move in with him, so my commute is shorter. I awkwardly laughed it off and say I don't think my boyfriend would be ok with that. Then he came up to me tonight to chat and I gave him some recommendations of ski resorts. He asked me to go up to one of the resorts to snowboard sometime. I don't understand why he keeps asking for my number and wanting to hang out. I have told him multiple times that I have a boyfriend.

Is it cruel to pleasure a guy to the point where he is about to climax and then just stop? What would be the appropriate reaction to this?,"TLDR: girl I very recently started dating gave me a hand job and right before I climaxes she stopped. Laughed about it. Then got upset when I asked her if she was just going to give me blue balls.

Should I have made a comment about giving me blue balls? What would‚Äôve been the appropriate response?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
  (I tried using talk-to-text to write the post)

I have been starting to see a new girl that I met on a dating app. To date we‚Äôve hung out three times. The first time was just dinner nothing major but pretty good first date all things considered. We kind of had a connection and kept talking for that next week.

Our second went way better. We were supposed to meet at a restaurant for dinner. At the last minute though she canceled and asked if I wanted to go over to her place instead. She said she felt bad for canceling at the last minute and wanted to keep our date.

Second date goes really and I wind up staying the night. There is definitely a connection and some intimacy. By which I mean cuddling and snuggling all night. I played it cool and didn‚Äôt even try to kiss her. 

I wound up staying over pretty much all morning and at this point we were getting more passionate. She wouldn‚Äôt kiss me on the lips but we were pecking and necking.A lot of grinding too.

Third date ends up being dinner at her house in the middle of the week. Which I think is a really good sign for how things are progressing overall. 

Things start getting heavy real quick. We are kissing at this point and dry humping. Her hand goes down into my pants and she starts giving me a hand job. Touchdown.

Things are moving along then. She can feel the pre-jizz and she abruptly stops and says ‚Äúok, that‚Äôs enough‚Äù and kind of laughs and kisses me on my cheek.

I was like ‚Äúummmm, what? Are you joking‚Äù I kind of nervously asked her. I wasn‚Äôt mad. I was genuinely bewildered. It wass the weirdest thing

She was like ‚ÄúYep all done‚Äù and just laid with me and kind of was giggling and laughing. How she normally is.

I then said ‚Äúare you seriously just giving me blue balls? ‚Äú I wasn‚Äôt mad. I didn‚Äôt raise my voice. I just asked are you really giving me blue balls?

She got super uptight and just started cleaning up the coffee table. She wasn‚Äôt like super mad. She was just quiet and it clearly bothered her. Obviously I wasn‚Äôt trying to offend her. And my tone wasn‚Äôt angry or anything. I was trying to kind of play it off as a joke.

I mean, I didn‚Äôt push the issue when she said she was done. I was kind of just sitting there. If she‚Äôs done, *she‚Äôs done*. I can‚Äôt make her do anything. I think it‚Äôs pretty understandable though that I was a little, I wouldn‚Äôt say frustrated because, I wasn‚Äôt angry in anyway. I was more confuses and uncomfortably. Both physically and emotionally.

Physically because I had a raging hard on. And emotionally because I don‚Äôt know if I did something wrong or what it was all about.

We made up really fast after. And I think she felt kind of bad because she kept asking me if I was OK. And she made the first move to come lay down with me.  

She said we will save making out till we are ready to have sex.

I swept the whole issue right underneath the rug-and played it off like nothing ever happened and the rest of the night was fine. I slept over. We hugged and kissed before we left for work and yeah.

I want to be able to tell her that it really bothered me and that I would prefer something like that didn‚Äôt happen again. I definitely can‚Äôt tell her in the moment because that would come up creepy as fuck. So I guess I have to let her know before hand.

It‚Äôs kind of bothering me that she got mad from me asking about blue balls.

Looking for some male input here. Please be brutally honest and sincere. 
I had my first very serious relationship in high school. We dated for 2 years and ultimately broke up because we were going to college on opposite ends of the country and didn‚Äôt want to hold each other back. He made that decision for us both and I was heartbroken at the time but reflecting back, I‚Äôm very grateful for the growth and self love it provided me. We spoke for most of college and admittedly would hook up over breaks as well. We always had this background unspoken agreement we would end up together some day and had discussed it drunkenly one day. 
I ended up starting to date someone my senior year and all contact stopped between us then.  While I am happy now, I still want to catch up just like I do old friends. It‚Äôs been about 3 years since then. 
My question is would you find this weird or like it was a reach or implying something if you were my ex, or is is sometimes nice for males too to hear from an ex in a friendly way.

How can i be in a serious relationship being a single mother?,"I'm a 21 yo single mom, got pregnant when i was 17 and my daughter is almost 4 yo. I used to be very religious but made a mistake with a boy i was dating (met him at school) and we broke up shorter after i found i was pregnant, he is not present in the baby's life. So, i always had a dream of getting married and im excited to get to know new people now that my daughter is a little bigger, so i started to go on a few dates, but nothing happened, only talking and having a meal together. So, the thing is: i got back to church and i'm now trying my best to live my life as the bible says, so even though i have a daughter already i don't want to be sexually active before marriage. I love my daughter but it really hurts the fact that i became a single mom even though i always wanted to wait until marriage and have a beautiful family with my baby's father. With that being said, do you think men would agree to be in a serious relationship with me? And how do i know if the guy has good intentions such as getting married? I really wanted to date a religious men that has the same faith as me, but i get insecure with the fact that men avoid single moms. I usually don't tell i have a daughter when i start to talk to someone, so they would get to know me before they make any assumptions about me, but if i feel a conection than of course i would tell them as sooner as i feel comfortable.",AskMen,1602387204,popdensity,45,1,True,2020-10-10

"How to get a girlfriend, during quarantine, WITHOUT leaving my house?","What¬¥s up, Reddit, I was wondering if you could give me some advice. I am a 21 years old man.

I actually planned to proposal to at least propose to be the boyfriend of one girl I really like during this year, (after I finished college) but only if I managed to accompany her as a friend more often (and in person). Therefore, during March, COVID-19 came around to my country, and stopped me on my tracks on visiting my friends, and especially this girl I like. I live with my parents, and my mom doesn¬¥t allow me to exit home except when I go to the grocery shop. I then entered in a kind of social anxiety because the thought of depending EXCLUSIVELY on social media to mingle and connect with people outside of my house, was terrifying. I retreated from a volunteer social group, and had a tough time completing my first forced virtual semester (which wasn¬¥t actually too bad, but my teammates often had trouble when I was afraid to speak or lead first). 

Today I discovered that one odd guy I met a long time ago got a girlfriend, probably during quarantine. However, I can¬¥t compare to him because he lives alone and can get out more easily of his house than me xD but this awakened something on me. I want now to connect more with my girl during these trying times.

I managed to send her a love letter this week. It was super effective. However, I want to do more things more than send letters and watching stuff together like in Netflix party. What activities I can do to keep building a good relationship before I declare to her when I finish my college school? In addition, how and when I should propose to her to be his boyfriend if I can¬¥t have freedom to visit her yet in person?",AskMen,1602390368,Red-Compatriot,0,1,True,2020-10-10

"How do I ask out a guy that ""gets rejected so often that he feels weird about acceptance""?","Hi there,

I recently went on a ""date"" with a friend of a friend. I didn't know it was a date when I showed up. When he texted me, he asked me to ""hang out"" and I didn't think too much because he is aware that I had just got out of an abusive relationship, and was not trying to see someone yet. However, he surprised me with his first move that night and I realized I want to know him more and show interest. I knew him before my ex and back then, and my friend told him I only saw him as a casual hook up partner (I was finishing up school and didn't know where I am headed to next, he was looking for someone to settle down with so I didn't want to waste his time if I had to move out of state or so), but now is a little different . I do want to make this clear and let him know that I am not only interest in the physical but also him as a person. It doesn't have to work out, but I would really want to see if it could

We talked a decent amount that night, and he told me that because he has been rejected for so many times, he feels weird about acceptance now. It's not that he is afraid of commitment. He explained it to me but I honestly can't remember how it is since we discussed so many other things that night.

My question now is, how do I handle and pursue this without ruining it? Usually when I am interested, I just go for it and it usually plays out pretty nicely since turns out guys my age find it attractive when women make their moves. I thought I will come here to ask for some more insight since it does look like he has a bit of special case here.",AskMen,1602400303,aglittercat,12,1,True,2020-10-11

What's the appeal for fantasy type porn and sex games?," I 24[F] recently found out my boyfriend 35[M] has been watching a certain type of porn which porn itself is no big deal because every guy out there watches it, but my issue is that it's like fantasy type ish and I'm not sure what the appeal is to it? So I'm just trying wrap my head around this because I honestly don't get it. But maybe I can somewhat understand it a little? Idk. Probably not. But hopefully.

So I already know I'm gonna get some backlash for this and I've already had my fair share of guilt over by doing this, but so how I found it was I looked on his computer history while he was sleeping because I was just curious as to what kind of stuff he was into when he masturbates and maybe I could do something he watched or whatever because he doesn't really tell me what he's into, and so I just took some pics of his history and watched and looked them up at home. 

Anyway I found some like alien manga where this guy basically f*cks this female alien. And then there's this like Wow hentai type stuff which has an orc and elf f*cking which I guess it's a game and that was just a clip that was on a site. But I also found quite a few of those games that he's visited and I'm assuming played in the past few weeks because there was multiple sites that I saw. And most of it is like elfs, orcs, druids..etc.",AskMen,1602401202,Browneyedloser,1,1,True,2020-10-11

Do you have any advice when it comes to feeling less jealous and petty?,"So a quick run down of the situation, I‚Äôve been spending time with a friend recently, like hanging out almost every day and talking with them over discord and shit. Today I tried to talk to this friend and they were sort of blowing me off, like they hit me up first but wouldn‚Äôt carry any conversation. I spoke with them on discord because they half ass said earlier they wanted to play a game with me (I asked if they had plans, they said yes, I said enjoy, they said ‚Äúokay don't join me [on X] then.‚Äù) I asked them if they wanted me to, they said ‚Äúthat's up to you‚Äù (playing hard to get) I said sure I‚Äôm down if they want to, then they pretty much ghosted me. I got into a call with them, they barely spoke a word to me and said ‚Äújoin us I guess‚Äù (as they were with someone else they repeatedly bring up as ‚Äòso much better than me‚Äô in most conversations.‚Äô) I asked them who they were with and how do I join and they say nothing to me for 20 or so minutes. After of which I decide I feel like I‚Äôm over staying my obvious unwanted-ness so I tell them to HMU if they need anything, and on queue someone else joins the call and all of the sudden my friend is just chatting up a storm with them; they say more to them in 10 seconds then they said to me in 20 minutes. I left the call, they‚Äôre still talking, and now I just feel pissed off. 

Overall, I realize there‚Äôs the possibility behind the fact that we‚Äôve been spending a lot of time together and that maybe she doesn‚Äôt want me around, but to counter that she should‚Äôve at least told me to fuck off. So that leads me back to my question at hand: I feel petty and jealous as shit right now that they wouldn‚Äôt talk to me but will talk up a storm with someone else immediately of them being there; so how do I grow a pair and move on. I know it‚Äôs completely not a big deal, yet my mind keep telling me to feel jealous.

How do you stop obsessing?,"Currently seeing a girl I like a lot.  
She's very open and easily makes friends.   
Any time she's out seeing someone, I'm coming up with these stupid scenarios in my head where she runs away with someone else or cheats.  


I've never ever been like this. But, during my time as a single guy, almost every woman I slept with, I would later find out was married or had a bf. This has often happened to many of my male friends as well. Doesn't help that nearly every meme page on IG has that subject as a running gag.   


I'm not acting on it. I like giving a partner their freedom. I trust her and I know we're a terrific match. I don't act on the thoughts as I don't like being obsessive and keeping tabs. I do find myself almost wanting to communicate in a way that subtly cues for reassurance; so far, I've been able to refrain from doing so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that train of thought is toxic and could lead to toxic actions, if I weren't someone who self-assessed action. I'm not worried about the thoughts making me act out. But, I'd still appreciate figuring out a way to clear my head of that dumb shit and carry on about my business.

Men who‚Äôve been cheated on - how hard was it to push away thoughts and visualizations if your ex with the other guy?,[removed],AskMen,1601105652,ThrowMeToTheBay,0,1,True,2020-09-26
"Men of reddit, how do you deal with loving someone but not respecting them?","Firstly, I understand that everyone is biased towards themselves and we judge ourselves by intentions and others by actions so this bias is very hard to overcome. 

However I have been facing a recurring problem. I love certain people and when I get to know them and they open up to me, I find their decisions and character terrible and I lose respect for them  but the love is still there and I struggle. 

This happened with a girl I loved. We got very close, but she kept telling me her friends secrets and kept acting like an easy girl who has stories with everyone and telling me stories about it. I tried my hardest to not judge her and tried making her better. I failed. I never told her or showed her that my views of her changed  since I felt that to be hypocritical of me and judgemental. However I constantly caught myself going 'well what do you expect from her, shes just bad'whenever she does something bad to someone else. I wouldnt say she ever wronged me, however I wouldnt say I ever trusted her or gave her enough to wrong me. By time I just called things off and we no longer talk. I still think of her daily, and l thought of reconnecting multiple times; however, I always tell myself that it will end either way because we aren't compatible and I'm not pure towards her. 

This is currently also happening with my own brother. Hes not a straightforward dude, he admits it. And even admits that when hes called out of his sneaky ways he'll deny it but knows he got caught. I dont respect that. I generally hate people who are sneaky and think of it as a cowardly trait. To the point where I do not want to talk to him. 

I want to understand, am I being overly critical and righteous or is this normal? 

In essence, if my brother was a normal guy or the girl wasnt someone I loved I would just stop contacting them. I find it easier to choose to opt out of relations with people I do not necessarily like. However, when there is love involved I feel conflicted.

How do you find inspiration and stay motivated?,"Recently I've been binging The Office which features popular TV character Jim Halpert. 

I like to do research on TV shows and movies that I watch and I stumbled across the following description of the character Jim:

*""In the media, Jim is sometimes called an everyguy. In her article 'Breaking Out of the Frist-Job Trap' for U.S. News and World Report, Liz Wolgemuth used Jim's character as a template for an essay on under-motivated, young, college grads. In an article on stereotypical office worker profiles, Jim was identified as the worker who is 'drifting along in a job, \[while\] you put off asking yourself hard questions about career plans.""* \- Wikipedia

Upon reading this, I found myself relating to this quite a bit. I'm a young adult 2yrs out of college who wants to enjoy the career I'm in, but the insane amounts of work and long hours has been generating a lot of stress. Because of this, I frequently find myself unmotivated to simply work (hard) and idealize a job where I can clock in 40hrs and leave. It's even taken a toll on my personal life, as I stopped pushing myself to hit the gym after work and maintain a healthy diet like I used to. I dream of being successful, but I'm not even sure what successful means to me. And when discussions arise with my parents or my boss about, ""where do you see yourself 5 years from now,"" I always find myself dodging the question or failing to answer with much thought.

Have any of you guys been in a rut like this? How do you keep yourself motivated and/or find new avenues of motivation? How do you stay inspired and work towards achieving ""success""?",AskMen,1599791687,whaddupdawgs,10,1,True,2020-09-10
Not really sure how to phrase this,"So I'll start off by saying that my friends are pretty cool guys. We're chill with each other and all, and we never really had any fights.

Idk if I'm overthinking this, but how do I ask my friends if they really want to be my friends or if they're doing out of being nice in a non-confrontational way? Is there some gossip about me that they heard, but I didn't? How do I ask this without being overly clingy or confrontational?

Note: I'm an 18-year old senior. Growing up, I was bullied, and that really made me insecure about a lot of stuff, especially friends.

My boyfriend is still friends with an old FWB and I'm not sure how I feel about it. Any advice?,"So I've been dating this amazing man for about 6 months, and this last week he told me that he loved me for the first time. We see each other about 3 times a week because of our work schedules and things feel rock solid. We've had deeper conversations lately, and tonight he told me that he has remained friends with some of his past FWB. Most of them live in other states, so I don't worry about that- but there is one woman that lives close by, and occasionally, they will get together to shoot photography together.

She's very attractive, and he told me that since they have been friends, they have both had other relationships. However, I get the impression that she is not dating anyone. However, I'm not sure how I feel about my boyfriend who I love very much spending time with someone that he used to be intimate with. When we talked about it, he said that they would have never worked in a relationship, and that she has ""big sister vibes."" I trust him, but I can't help but feel insecure.

A little context: im a 21yr old living with my parents, i spent over a year at home due to taking a year long internship and i am going back to university in a week. Well, since being at home i have felt that every single day is a challenege with these people, they are never grateful fir what they have, they always shout, complain about the smallest things and swear infront of the kids, every single day.

They have taken just under ¬£9000 from both me and my sister and thry have no intention on paying that back...brilliant. My dad is the biggest moron i have ever met, he is so stupid its actually funny. Hes been in england for 25yrs and his english is still worse that a 3yr olds, he has no common sense and always thinks hes right. The other day we were swearing at each other because apprently im a ""lowlife"" who came home at 11pm for a couple of days in the week (out with my gf) now hes justs constantly calling me a motherfucker saying it would be better if i was dead and then has the nerve to say ""when i die youll know what a father is"" lol what?

Then my mum, she usually agrees with me 99% of the time but when my dad gets involved she jumps on his ship because shes scared of him (he got arrested for domestic violence when we were kids). I have never drank nor done drugs but my parents think i have the worst human alive just because ive been coming home at 11pm the past few days.

Apologies if this is not the place for that kind of question.

"Men,how picky are you when it comes to what you find physically attractive? Do you think you‚Äôre as picky(or not at all) as society makes you out to be when it comes to looks?","I had always been under the assumption that men were the pickier ones when it came to looks,and adhered more strictly to conventional beautiful standards. I would think that a guy would reject all brunettes,even if they were attractive,just because he preferred blondes. 

Now,I‚Äôm realizing that most men aren‚Äôt like that. It was enlightening to me to see that when my female friends would show me what women they found beautiful,they‚Äôd always show me Instagram models who fit a very strict idea of beauty. My male friends on the other hand,would show me a more diverse range of looks,and generally were less nitpicky about certain features. They‚Äôd show me a woman they thought was cute,and would usually justify it by saying ‚Äúoh she has a nice body‚Äù or ‚ÄúI like her eyes‚Äù.

"How do you deal with issues of self-confidence, especially in romance?","My friends all say that I am super eligible, have lots of good qualities and should have no problem finding a girlfriend/partner. Other than being a little on the short side (5""6) and being quite introverted and quiet, I'm apparently an ""ideal"" candidate. Yet, I have been single my whole life and have not quite lived up to the ""expectations"" that my friends and family have of me. It's really quite damaging to my self-confidence, as it makes me think that there's something wrong with me that I can't change.

Recently, some things happened between my best friend (F) and I, and she said she would consider dating me. Neither of us really confessed or made clear that we're interested in each other, but I think we both kinda knew that things could work out between us if we wanted to. Within a space of a month, she did a 360 and says she thinks we're just compatible as friends, and now she's dating someone else. Something obviously happened that caused this change and I can't help but think that its my fault. It's also really damaging to my self-confidence because she's always saying how much of a good guy I am, and how it would be no problem for me to find a partner.

I've always been hypercritical and extremely harsh on myself, which is a big part of why this is happening but I can't help it.  My self-confidence is pretty low now, especially when it comes to meeting new people and given my already introverted nature, it makes things even harder.

How do I (17M) make her (17F) prioritize me/her time spent with me higher?,"**Background:** I'm talking to this girl I've known for a long time (loosely known for 5 years, started properly talking 5 months ago). We've talked a lot about intimate topics such as attractiveness, sex, masturbation, etc. 2 months ago I asked her out to which she responded that she finds me attractive, but thinks me only as a friend. She then asked if we could try for friends with benefits, which I was down for. We texted and called a lot but never met, due to COVID, and ended up ending our arrangement because nothing was happening. We still talk and text a lot though.

So I've noticed her prioritizing things over spending time with me. On some days she'll want to Netflix party a movie with me, text a lot, play phone games or even have 3 hours calls. On other days she blows me off because she's about to start her yoga, reading, or studying. I understand if she wants to get those things done first but I, personally, would prioritize her over all of my hobbies (drumming, working out, running, etc).

My question is, how do I get her to prioritize me higher/value her time spent with me more? I've seen some techniques where I should make my time less available as well. Are there any other techniques you use?

"Men, what does it mean to feel too numb to love someone?","I (20F) met him (26) roughly two years ago. Long story short, we were roommates and ended up hooking up after a couple of months of knowing each other. I was attracted to him from the moment I first saw him, ape brain and all that, but when we hooked up, my heart became a whirlwind for him in every possible way. He‚Äôs the first person I think I‚Äôve ever loved. And he still is the only person I‚Äôve ever loved.

I am an over thinker by nature. I am also a romantic, and I tend to interpret major things in my life religiously, like they are stories or poems. I‚Äôm not a religious person. I am just an expressive person. I feel a lot. 

He is quite the opposite. Goofy, just... sort of light and airy. In a conversation with him, you can generally tell in what direction it‚Äôs going. And that direction is almost always light-hearted. Jokes on jokes, puns on puns, weird anecdotes from the internet and stories from his past that are weird and funny. He‚Äôs kind of awkward, like me. But you can tell it‚Äôs benevolent. He pays attention to things, and he‚Äôs aware of himself in conversation. He paces his words like he‚Äôs actually in the present moment with you. He appears so stoic and silly. You can tell, though, that he‚Äôs got very complex feelings and thoughts that he doesn‚Äôt share.

I confronted him about his lack of sharing emotion with me. Over text, of course, because it is hard to get him to hangout with me in person.

He says he wants to share his feelings but doesn‚Äôt know how to. That he‚Äôs numb sometimes because of his addiction to mindless comfort like pornography and weed.

He said, ‚ÄúI love you a lot. I‚Äôm just a depressed coomer with social anxiety, and it‚Äôs hard to get me out of my bullshit.‚Äù

It‚Äôs hard for me to understand this.

I am quite the opposite of numb. I cannot stand boredom, and if I feel it creeping on, I‚Äôll drive around my car and listen to music and think about my life instead. I‚Äôll draw, listen to music, visit a friend. But I am never... numb. I don‚Äôt not feel. I always feel something - happy, angry, sad. Mostly sad. So it‚Äôs hard for me to relate to his way of experiencing life. Numb...

And, especially towards me, it‚Äôs hard to understand. I cannot understand how you can love someone, but be indifferent or ‚Äúnumb‚Äù towards them or your feelings about them...

It is almost enough to push me away. As a matter of fact, it has... and he never fought to get me back. I always came back to him. I‚Äôve always been the one to push for us. Even though we‚Äôve never even dated officially.

And, his reason for that is, he doesn‚Äôt feel like he deserves it.

It breaks my heart to this day. Me and him, we‚Äôve been on this rope, teeter-tottering ever since we‚Äôve been intimate. But I feel that I‚Äôm wasting my time...

I‚Äôm joining the Air Force and in four months or less, I‚Äôll be moving away from our small town. And I don‚Äôt ever plan on coming back. 

The thought of leaving him is enough to send me to tears everytime. I don‚Äôt want to leave him. I want to be there for him, and I want him to be there for me.

When we talked about it (again, over text), he said, ‚ÄúWhere will you be stationed?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù I told him.

He said, ‚ÄúWell, with electrician training I‚Äôm sure I could find a decent job anywhere.‚Äù

What the fuck?

I entertained it in conversation, because I love him. But, when I read that, all I was really feeling was... hurt and confused.

He wants to move across the country with or for me, or he can think about it, but... he won‚Äôt respond to my text for hours when I ask him if he wants to hike with me one day? He doesn‚Äôt want to date me. He doesn‚Äôt initiate hangouts with me... or, he does, but maybe once every two weeks. If I‚Äôm lucky..

I just don‚Äôt understand. Maybe some insight will help.",AskMen,1597213745,opensigns,7,1,True,2020-08-11

"Guys who have or had bad relationships with their fathers, how was it? And did it get better?","im 19 and not really close with my dad. He cares for me and wants the best for me i know that but its just not the same as with my mum. No matter how annoying she can be i can go and talk to her. With my dad its just lots of forced conversations and short answers from me which has been like that for years and i‚Äôve only recently realised how bad it is. We could go to the shop and i‚Äôd just sit in silence the whole way there same as when walking to places and in the house. Most conversations are just him telling me to do something or something random. Also can‚Äôt really look him in the eye small times we do talk. And im quite an outgoing person amongst friends. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt go to him for advice of any sort rather just figure it out myself.

How can I (24M) ask my obese mother (50F) to lose weight (out of a place of genuine concern)?,"Long story short, my mom is 50 years old and morbidly obese. I love her dearly, so much so that I don't want her to die young like she is statistically likely to do in her current condition. She gets out of breath walking across a room and was recently hospitalized due to a blod clot issue. She has been bigger as far as I can remember, but she lost a bunch of weight 5 years ago on Weight Watchers. Then, then my dad left again for good and she put it all back on (and then some).

Both of her parents were obese and died young, while all of her aunts, uncles, and grandparents are either still alive or lived to their 90s. In other words, her chances of living a long life are good if she changes her behavior but bad if he doesn't.

"I‚Äôm sure this has been asked many times, but what‚Äôs it‚Äôs like having close friends and/or siblings that genuinely care for you and love you?","I am an only child. Growing up my dad never played catch with me or had cooked meals with my mom. Both my parents are immigrants from Korea. They both were owners of small businesses and worked all the time. Always remembered being dropped off at babysitters. I am also the youngest out my entire extended family. At home I always played with by myself. 
When I was younger I had lots of friends at school in elementary. At that time I had actual joy and felt like I had close friends. This continued up until about the summer of 7th grade. At that time I would always see my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù riding their bikes together hanging out at Starbucks, watching movies together and hang out at the mall without an invitation. At that part, that‚Äôs when school life started to suck. I always say with them at lunch, but felt left out as they would talk about things that I didn‚Äôt know at all. Beginning of high school brought high hopes. A fresh start. A chance to make life time friends. All that was ended the first day. My classes were full of people that I‚Äôve known for at least 5 years. The new people that I did meet didn‚Äôt seem interested in me at all. Every interaction at school felt fake. I was miserable and lonely all day everyday. The only thing that brought joy was leaving school. 
At church, i thought that those were my true friends. I felt like I actually belonged to a group of friends. It stayed that way for a while, but people came and went. Upper class men graduated and individuals have left. Now I‚Äôm the only one in my grade and also the oldest out of my entire youth group.

"Guys, how do you like to be apologized to by a woman? Or what can we women do to get you back and make up?","Hey connected with this guy online back in March and we live in different states.  We had instant connection and chemistry but literally almost as soon as we connected covid and quarantine hit. His state went into lock down.  I was furloughed and then laid off. We talked daily, texted constantly, video chatted a few times a week, emailed, even wrote hand written letters in the mail and sent small items from our home states.  
We sexted a few times but never sent or asked for nudes and kept it classy with friendship that friend into desire and a real connection. The compatibility and chemistry is real and like nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced and we‚Äôve never even touched. We planned to meet and each time it didn‚Äôt work, the 14 day mandatory quarantine continues to be extended. 

A few days ago I messed up. I‚Äôm the woman here. I didn‚Äôt know why at the time. But I got triggered and just started a fight in text. We went back and forth for like 5 hours.  Not like me at all.  I was in full attack mode. Barely remember what was said and was a total bitch.  Hurtful. All I can think is I was on Norco for pain meds after surgery and was out of it and didn‚Äôt know how Norco would affect me. I felt mad angry and depressed for about three days. Some friends told me they had a similar experience in pain meds.
 When they told me I tossed the bottle and just felt so terrible.  The texting ended badly and escalated to the point of ending our relationship.   I‚Äôm devastated.  

I tried to explain what happened or what I think happened. And I feel normal again now.  But what a mind fuck. To have the girl you thought you knew blow up out of nowhere over literally nothing.  So I totally get it.  It‚Äôs really not me though. I am not a head case. As soon as the drugs were out of my system I felt like life returned but left with pain. The emotional far outweighs the physical.  

I‚Äôve written an email to explain and thoroughly apologize but seems he‚Äôs not accepting it and doesn‚Äôt believe it was just the pain meds. 

What can I do to salvage this relationship?  What actions would you want as a guy on the other side?  I showed my friends the texts and they said yeah you were a psycho bitch. We know it‚Äôs not you but he does not.  I‚Äôm going to never forgive myself if I‚Äôve ruined us

Re: What is it like to get kicked in the balls?,"I here allot of women ask this. Sometimes there is debate as to whether the experience is comparable to childbirth. So here is my answer, which I hope will clear up this confusion once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

The male testicle contains a similar amount of nerve ending to the female clitoris, and is just as sensitive.

So ladies, imagine you have *2* clits, except they are not the size of your finger nail (as 1 typically might be), but are instead as large and round as chicken eggs.

Unlike the clitoris you possess currently, however, these are not kept safe within your pelvis, but are haphazardly held in a thin fleshy sack, open to the elements like a hobo in a blizzard.

Sound fun? No, it's awful.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine some jackass kicks these big clities with the ferocity of a pro soccer player.

Not only do you experience pain, but the debilitation which follows can best be described as shooting electrical pains throughout your entire nervous system, and just like being hit with a stun gun or taser, you are nearly unable to move because all of your muscles are convulsing and locked in place.

&amp;#x200B;

some guys blackout. If a serious injury occurs in this region we can actually die from the rapid blood loss in under 10 minutes.

I've seen people who are the assertive ones, the ones you can count on, the dominant ones, who know how to use their mind and not let feelings overpower them, the urbane gentlemen kind; refined, classy, well dressed/learned.

I am a manager at a restaurant and my girlfriend of 6 years is a team member there as well.

During our breaks we have to be in the dining room unless your a manager there is a managers office. If you are in the dining room you are required to wear a mask unless you are eating. When I am in the office on my breaks (even when I‚Äôm not eating) I take off my mask because I am not in line of sight of customers. Her and another worker came at me verbally very aggravated yesterday in front of all the employees, because they are required to wear a mask in the lobby but I can take it off in the office.

"Men who are with less attractive women, how do you stop daydreaming about being with other more attractive women?","My girlfriend is the sweetest girl I ever been with. She is my rock. She's thoughtful, supports me in everything I do, and appreciates everything I do for her. All my friends and family love her too. She's very warm and welcoming. We rarely ever fight because she's very level headed and forgiving. She's wife material and I know 100% that she would be an awesome mother. 

BUT she's not as attractive as other girls I've been with in the past and I always daydream about being with other girls who are hot. The really hard thing is that some of these girls show interest in me and or are flirty. I'm not out hitting on girls or even going to bars/clubs, many of these girls I meet at my crossfit gym. I just get weak in the knees a hot girl tells me ""we should hang out!"" and I can't stop thinking about her. 

I try to remind myself of ex's who were HOT but were totally selfish, always in a bad mood, and being with them was just a drain of my energy and well being. Then I also think, what if that other hot girl is just as sweet as my GF but more attractive? I know I have a keeper of a GF and leaving her for a HOT girl is a risky move that could leave me on the far end of the crazy hot scale.

How to approach dating &amp; making friends in your early 20's outside of college?,"I go to an out-of-state college, and all my classes have been put online, so it looks like I will be staying home until January when spring classes are hopefully back in-person. Unfortunatelly, I have ZERO friends in my hometown, and quarantine has really showed me how lonely I am.  I was the textbook social awkward nerd in highschool who ate alone at lunch, so I didn't keep in contact with anyone from high school, nor did I want to.  The past 2 summers made me realize why summer is my least favorite time of the year.  I have no friends durring summer, and baiscally do nothing but work and save money for rent for the fall semester.  Now that I know I am staying home, I am unsure how I will spend my free time outside of online classes and part-time work this fall.  I turned 21 this year and was hoping to go around bars &amp; clubs in NYC this summer to hopefully meet new people, but covid19 cancelled those plans.  I should also mention my hometown is not a ""young people's"" town, basically just suburbs with nothing for people in their 20's to do. Also, at my job I only work with 2 other guys, both being 15 &amp; 30 years older than me, so hanging out with coworkers is off the table.

On top of having no friends in my hometown, I haven't had an active dating life since before quarantine, and don't plan to hop back into dating until things get better.  I am confident things will continue to get better where I live in the upcoming months (New Jersey), but I am unsure about how to go about dating not only post quarantine, but outside of college in general.  My hometown isn't really anywhere near a college campus, and like I said earlier I have no friends around here so going to house parties is out of the equation.  When I'm at college, the majority of my dating is though dating apps (the life of an engineering student who doesn't meet girls in class lol), and ocasionally meeting people through friends and clubs.  When I came home for summer &amp; winter break in 2018 &amp; 2019, I never even met a girl or had any kind of relationship, simply because I don't know where to meet women my age when I'm home.  Now that I know I will be here for the next 6+ months, I need to learn how to meet girls my age because I don't want to continue to be lonely.  The only good thing is that I am currently having more luck now on dating apps then I did the last 2 summers, probably because I learned how to take a decent photo of myself.  So I do have a dozen or so potential dates at the moment, but again I don't plan to hop on it because of quarantine.  Aside from meeting girls, the thing I am most worried about though is going through the awkwardness of bringing a girl home when my parents are home for the first time (They are home 100% of the time at night and most of the time durring the day, so no avoiding them).  At college I never had to worry about this because it's just me and my roomates who are barely in our appartment anyway. On top of the awkwardness of girls meeting my parents, I also have my gross older brother living with us, and he never cleans any messes and leaves the bathroom the 2 of us share an utter mess.

Why do dumb people think clinical depression is entirely genetic?,"

Science says clinical depression is caused by a combination of factors. You are born with a genetic predisposition, and your environment can help pull the trigger. So why are ignorant people saying that it‚Äôs entirely genetic? It‚Äôs not just genetics that play a role.

‚ÄúAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, genetic, environmental, biological, and psychological factors all have the potential to contribute to the development of Major Depressive Disorder. While it is not possible to predict exactly who will be impacted by depression, certain risk factors for MDD do exist.‚Äù

Physically (whether skinny or chubby/thick) and especially mentally I relate to women much older than me far more than women my age. Here's the thing, I've been on tinder/bumble for a while and I always attract single (usually thick) moms my age, which is great and all, but mentally I don't really relate or enjoy being with these women. I want to find a mature woman so bad, the more stereotypical a mom-bod, the more I'm attracted. Saggy Mom titties and a thick mom ass, jesus I want it in my life so bad. Me and my buddy have been talking about it (and joking extensively about it as it *is* hilarious*), but if she cooked delicious food and we watched netlfix and 'chilled' all the time, I'd be in heaven. 
  
I don't want to resort to escorts that's ridiculous and the authenticate type of woman I'd want wouldn't approve of that anyways. If I go on tinder/bumble and set my age preferences to mature women, there's almost no women to pick from and you'll never get a response they just assume you're a troll or a creep.

"How do I get my husband that my inability to get the big ""O"" isn't because of him but instead because of the BC I'm on?","Hey everyone! I added the NSFW tag thing cause it's sexual content and I don't want anyone getting in trouble because I didnt put the tag.

So, I'm 21F, my husband is 25M. We have two kids together, our oldest (Son) is 3 years. Our youngest (Daughter) is 11 months old and she plays a part in this, so to speak.

So, long story short. Since I got pregnant with Daughter, I've had problems getting an orgasm. Not due to my husband's performance, but because of the hormones I had coursing through me throughout the pregnancy. It wasn't as bad while I was pregnant with her than it is now. I could still get off ohkay, it just took a bit extra effort and time. After I had Daughter, I was put on the Cryselle birth control pill, and since I was put on it, my orgasms have been basically nonexistent and my husband thinks it's because of him, when I know it's not. I know it's not because I have trouble with getting an orgasm doing it by myself. Before getting pregnant with Son, during the pregnancy, and after having him, my getting off was perfect and easy. I had no troubles, even after being put on the Depo shot. I didn't do the depo again after Daughter because of the weight gain (went from 160-ish to almost 200 in the first month), and the way it messed with my periods (it made them SO much worse and I couldnt handle it). The cryselle has helped my periods a lot, but it has it own set of downsides, obviously. I want to know how I can make my husband know that my difficulties aren't because of him or his performance, but because of the birth control I'm on? He knows when I'm faking an orgasm, so I cant do that, and I'm a terrible liar. He doesn't believe me any time I tell him what's going on, and it's really hurting me emotionally. I don't want him to feel so bad about himself and spend lord knows how long upset over it. Thanks in advance &lt;3&lt;3",AskMen,1594624408,_ThrowRA-Mom98,25,1,True,2020-07-13

"i'm a male with inverted nipple and it blows, any tips on how i could deal with them?"," 

I'm 17 6'0ft 160, and I've had inverted nipples pretty much all my life. I never noticed it much as a kid but as i got older i started to realize how different they were from everyone else's. Taking off my shirt in public in pretty much a no go for me which sucks because i love to swim and be shirtless in general. I'm a fairly confident person and i honestly don't care about other peoples perception of me, but my nipples are my Achilles heel and i feel like i'm in the dark about it. I'm aware of the nipple inversion surgeries out there but as far as i know they cost thousands. I was considering nipple piercings since they look kinda cool but i'm not sure they would be a good option as they probably wouldn't be well received by my family or society in general. And since i'm still in high school i don't know if i want to walk around with 2 metal bars showing through my shirt lol. They aren't severely inverted and they do come out if i fuck around with them a little bit. But still a massive blow to the confidence-bone.

I know it's sort of common for women, but i can't find anything on men with inverted nipples :( anyone else here have the same issue and have any tips on confidence or any idea on how i could deal with them? Do girls find them off putting?",AskMen,1593317078,ItsMyHeaven,10,3,True,2020-06-27

I don't see myself as a threatening guy at all. I'm short and pretty overweight. In most cases I've been good friends with these girls for years, with our friendship always being platonic. I've seen it with new friends and their bf's as well, which I understand because they don't know me as well maybe.

Ladies and gentlemen of AskMen. But more specifically ladies of AskMen What does ‚Äúyou two make a cute couple‚Äù truly mean when girls say that.,"The backdrop. 

I have been the ‚Äútoken single guy‚Äù of my group for a while. In my early 20‚Äôs my philandering ways often irked the women of my clique because I specifically swooped the friends of the girls in my group. 

Had a bit of growing up to do. What more can I say? 

Anyway. Finally. I‚Äôve been going steady with the same girl in the weeks leading up to lockdown. Through it. And after it. So I meet a girl at some store. Have a convo which led to a number swap. Which led to a week of texting. Which led to an actual date. Which led to a couple more. Which led to exclusivity. But not publicity. We went on a final date and then decided to to official.

So. The week before our lord and savior locked down my state we had a piss up. Went out. Fucked em up. Shut em down. I wanted her to experience my circle. So I brought her.

Immediately. Every girl in my wide array of lunatics was ‚ÄúOmg you two are such a cute couple‚Äù and ‚Äúyou two are so cute together‚Äù

Then... she comes by my place for dinner. And my roommate (female) who never once saw her immediately blurred out the same remark.

How do I cope with and support a partner with sexual trauma whilst dealing with the impact it has on our sex life?,"I had a very active sex life with my partner when we were not in a relationship. In fact a great deal of our relationship in the initial stages was heavily based on how sexually compatible we were.

We were friends for about 10 years that shagged but over the years our friendship grew stronger and stronger and we would just enjoy hanging out for more than just sex. The relationship evolved into a lot more about a year ago and we started dating officially. We have continued to fall more and more in love with each other and I love her immensely.

About 4-5 months ago I noticed it began to be mainly me initiating sex. Previously she was the one initiating probably more than me or at least equal.

It was bothering me for awhile and I started doubting her attraction to me, wondering if she is getting it somewhere else or if I had done something to upset her. I finally asked her what‚Äôs up and explained how it is really starting to make me feel insecure and a little pathetic like I‚Äôm being a pest by being attracted to her.

She broke down and explained that she has some serious sexual trauma‚Äôs from some past relationships. She got back into therapy and has been trying to work on it as it has affected past relationships when she has really fallen hard for someone. She reassured me that it was not me and she is still madly attracted to me it‚Äôs control related and she just needs to work on it. I reassured her that I love her for more than just sex and I will leave the initiation to her while she deals with this stuff.

I felt much better in understanding where it was coming from.

It‚Äôs been nearly 3 months since we have had sex and it‚Äôs really impacting me. Its making me feel unwanted, unattractive and undesirable. I can go without sex no problem, I was sex less for a period of a year at one stage when I was focusing on being alone and it wasn‚Äôt really an issue. But being with a partner I love and am attracted to and not having sex it just feels like a massive part of the intimacy between us is missing.

I had a woman strike up a conversation with me on a walk the other day and got subtle vibes that there was interest and I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt entertain the thought of flirting with her. It makes me angry and selfish for even having these thoughts but I am getting desperate to feel some passion returned.

I just don‚Äôt know how to handle this long term if this is what she needs. Even though I understand the reasons it doesn‚Äôt change the impact it‚Äôs having on me emotionally.

I just thought maybe there are men out there who have had a similar situation with their partners and could provide some advice or just their experience so it feels less crushingly isolating.",AskMen,1590727537,Nordicarts,28,1,True,2020-05-28

"Are there any books that I can read to help me better know how to help a female friend through sexual trauma, or at least know how to offer better support?","I posted this in Ask Women already, but I figure there will be good responses here too.

I was talking to a friend of mine tonight, and she told me about a childhood experience that has really affected her. The details don't matter, and I honestly dont have many myself because she cut out over the phone sometimes, but the gist was she and some of her friends were young and copying something one of them saw in a movie.

She'd never told anyone about it, but it was on her mind because one of them approached her recently to apologize about that day. Which took a lot of guts. She struggles with it because they were all so young (~9) and though it felt wrong they didnt realize it until much later. Shes forgiven them all, but its still a burden.

For the longest time the memory was suppressed, and now that it's out she wants to work on it but doesnt know how. She is a social worker herself but doesnt know where to start with it, so I had her tell me what she'd do if a student came to her with that situation, and I did my best to help her organize some thoughts and see how its affected her.

Some more parts of her fell into place in my head after hearing this, her struggles with trust, thinking people will respect her boundaries, and thinking that men will eventually objectify her.

I think we will talk about it again, but I want to be better prepared. Shes not the first girl who has opened up to me about sexual trauma, and I fear she wont be the last. I'm pretty good about advice and helping people navigate emotions, but I felt out of my element tonight and I'd like to get better.

For anyone trained in this or who has gone through this, what are some things I can do to help her navigate this? Are there any good books about this as well that provide help for someone who is helping someone else cope and has actionable things or strategies for the person going forward?

Thanks in advance. And sorry if this is a little disjointed, it's late but I wanted to make a post before I forgot.",AskMen,1590729125,Babbledoodle,12,1,True,2020-05-28

Men of Reddit: Why Are Some Girls Great To Hang Out With But Never Date?,"I'm sorry for the length of this post but this is something that has been bothering me for a while and figured I'd ask for some advice.

I have many guy friends that I'm comfortable hanging out with and vice versa. My guy friends feel comfortable confiding several things about with me and getting advice. They know I'm not going to tell anyone unless it's a situation where someone's life is in danger or something illegal is going on. Some of them have even told me that I'm pretty and that I'd make someone a great girlfriend/wife someday.

However, I've never been asked out by anyone on a date and it makes me wonder why. I'm not the most attractive woman out there, sure. But that seriously can't be all that there is to that.

Though my penis has become used to porn, I can get hard very very easily, and am very horny when making out with my girlfriend. (Part of why I get hard so easily is my dick is only like 4.5 inches and naturally curves up)

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a psychological problem because of how hard and horny I get, so I‚Äôm wondering if this could be desensitized nerves in my penis due to rough masturbating (when I masturbate it‚Äôs normally pretty rough and little lube) and all the salvia/ the slowness of a blowjob caused me to not be able to finish, or maybe my girlfriends head ability‚Äôs?

As we are unloading all of our stuff, or lack there of, we notice my tacklebag, 4 of my brothers poles, his tacklebag, and his trolling motor are all gone. So, we call the non emergency line and the cops go to the store that we were just at to check the cameras. Well, the store was basically closing so he didn't get a long chance to look over different views and such. He called us back and said he would look them over more carefully tomorrow.

I have physiological erectile dysfunction at 18. How do I fix this? Please Help!,"I'm 18 years old. Since one year, my erection has slowly deteriorated. Here are my symptoms:

* I don't wake up with morning wood at all, and can't remember the last time I did.
* I don't get any random erections throughout the day. If at most it gets to 40-50% erection for a few seconds.
* I can't get an erection without several minutes of physical contact, and the erection goes away in 10-15 seconds without physical contact.
* When I masturbate, the maximum hardness my erection gets is like 70%. It is still quite soft/limp but I manage to get the job done. It isn't firm enough to stay up when I stand up and bends down. It definitely isn't hard enough for penetration.
* When I clench my pc muscles (kegel hold), it temporarily gets bigger/firmer but only for a few seconds. The size increase is quite drastic (0.5 inch). I think it gets to around 90% when I clench.
* I have a lower libido as compared to a few years ago

This wasn't always the case as I don't remember having any problems when I was younger. I would also get random erections frequently a few years ago. I've slowly noticed my condition getting worse.

I've tried several things to fix this:

* Started getting healthy. I've lost 30 kg in the past 1 year. I'm quite lean now. My bmi is 19. I'm eating healthy foods and lift weights 3-4 times a week. I've put on some muscle as well. I've recently started a proper bulk cycle to build lean mass.
* I'm taking zinc supplements.
* Have never been addicted to porn as I've always preferred looking at pictures of hot models.
* Attempted no-fap several times. Highest streak being 45 days when I noticed no improvement and have lost faith in it. I now masturbate only once every 3-4 days.

I might have either low testosterone (which I'm getting checked for once the lockdown is over), venous leak, or pelvic floor problems. I've started a kegel routine to see if it has any benefits.

I can't go to a doctor as I live in a country (India) where I don't have insurance for it. I also can't talk about it with my dad as it's an uncomfortable topic, especially with Indian parents.",AskMen,1585537057,kalavoyce,0,1,True,2020-03-29
How do you develop camaraderie with your boss?,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm 27F and my boss is 40M. I've been at my job for close to half a year and I haven't been able to be myself around my boss. I'm intimidated by him because he's my superior (afraid of getting in trouble or saying something wrong) and I have to admit I'm a bit attracted to him. I now try to avoid seeing him whenever I can. When I first started I would go into his office whenever I needed to, to ask questions or to turn in stuff. Now I just ask him questions over chat or drop things off in his mailbox. I'll say hi and bye if I see him in the hallway but other than that we don't really talk. When I first started he would try to make small talk to get to know me and I would respond with small talk, but now he doesn't because I guess I've been giving off a shy vibe. It's just so awkward now. I'm not shy and can be myself around my other coworkers but I cannot seem to relax/be myself around my boss. How do I fix this? I do have to mention that my boss is also introverted and is not the most outgoing person according to my coworkers who have been there long, but he gets along with and seems comfortable with everyone because they've all worked together for 5+ years.

"Hi there men, how can I approach my fiance about lack of passion?","Sorry if the title sounds crude or lacking of empathy, or if the post itself does. I just want to get a guy's take on this if willing.
Obligatory I love my partner to the moon; we have been together almost three years, and plan to get married in the next. Started off with any good ol' honeymoon phase--one I'd actually consider lasted longer than usual--and have lived together for the majority of our relationship (kinda just happened, we are great housemates). We consider each other best friends and have an open line of communication about almost everything... except one. I'm a horny gal. I have multiple toys and would honestly use them everywhere from the kitchen to the bedroom if I could, but he's just not into it. I could fuck all day. He'd rather bang one out for a few minutes and be done with it. Sex between us happens when I pursue it, 99% of the time. The 1% is when he's got morning wood, which is awesome but... I just feel like we're heading towards a passionate-less relationship. We have talked about it more than once, and it honestly used to frustrate me, but at this point I'm just plain bummed and feel like I'm doing something wrong or he really just doesn't care. Like, I took off my engagement ring a few days ago and he still hasn't said anything.
So, if anyone even takes the time to read this, lemme know a thought or two. And again, sorry if this reads as pathetic or lacking of empathy for my man. I really miss him.",AskMen,1585537534,belalugozi666,3,1,True,2020-03-29

Keeping in touch with a girl after coronavirus,"Pretty trivial and useless question to be asking, but hey, it's quarantine time.

There's a girl I met at a party(ish) on the last day before our school forced us out, and luckily, I got her instagram handle before then. That was a couple of weeks ago now. She replied to my story about the end of the school year, and we had a quick little exchange about it (6 messages tops).

What do you guys think about replying to her story now and trying to keep a conversation going?

How to completely move on?,"
It‚Äôs been about 9 months since i broke it off with my ex. She was studying abroad and I felt the distance since the start of her trip, which led to finding out she‚Äôs been lying about certain whereabouts and people she was with. Ended up breaking up while she was still there, due to her constantly lying about things that i knew she was lying about. Crazy thing is I was actually flying out towards the end of her trip to surprise her and propose to her. 

We were together for about 3 years and she would always talk about marriage. I truly believed she was the one. Things changed in a blink of an eye. Idk who she is anymore. Although I didn‚Äôt want it to end, I mainly wanted her to communicate and be real with me. She hit me with the she‚Äôs not ready to talk and that she‚Äôs not ready for a relationship. I let it go, she would contact me every few weeks asking how I‚Äôm doing and that she misses me, but still never able to talk to me about what really happened. She would say things like she‚Äôs not the woman I deserve and that she‚Äôs working on herself and she thinks with more time things would be better between us. Well recently I found out she‚Äôs been dating someone else, going on trips with him, possibly even living together. I‚Äôm over it for the most part, but at times I still can‚Äôt understand wtf happened. How do we go from being the perfect couple to complete strangers. 

I guess I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how to completely let go and not overthink when she crosses my mind. It‚Äôs exhausting. For the most part I‚Äôm good, I can go months without worry or thinking about her, but at a random moment I think about her and lose my shit.

might be falling for a close friend,"using a throwaway for privacy. so a few months ago, i met a girl in class (university) and found her attractive. we talked for a couple days and i was planning on asking her out, but she caught on to my advances and told me she has a boyfriend (with some very vague indications she was not happy with him). so at this point i was like ok no problem, it was just a basic attraction so i can be friends with this girl. we both really enjoy being around each other and are basically the same person personality-wise (other than me having more confidence). weve gotten so close over the past few months very gradually at first but now we see each other at least 3 times a week. i make her laugh so hard she almost pees herself, and she comes over often to drink and just listen to music and talk (its been strictly platonic other than flirty shoulder punches and shit like that). i know the first thought is gonna be ‚Äúif shes comfortable doing this to him then she‚Äôll do it to you too‚Äù but clearly if she wasnt loyal she would have made a move by now or taken me up on my date in the first place. i get the feeling that shes into me, but the problem is shes very insecure and has opened up about it to me before. she is not at all happy in her current relationship which has been deteriorating even longer than i‚Äôve known her. she is scared to leave him because she thinks no one will date her, legitimately, she has explained its not fishing for compliments either. her bf is a complete fuckup just from hearing her complaints about him, but he has her manipulated via guilt to stay in the relationship. he tells her ‚Äúyoure gonna have to break up with me because i love you more than you love me‚Äù.

so anyways i had been holding my tongue as i kept developing stronger feelings, and i am definitely no homewrecker. but as a very empathetic person hearing this got me to tell her that i would date her if she was single, because as someone who used to be very insecure she deserved to know that. she seemed really surprised at first and then smiled and said i‚Äôll definitely keep that in mind. and this was earlier this week. she regularly talks about her bf in a negative way and is in a long distance relationship with him. as long as ive known her she has gone to see him twice and he has never bothered to come up and see her. as i mentioned before she is VERY shy so i dont think she would outright say she has feelings for me especially in a relationship, but i am confident there is definitely at least some interest. i‚Äôm not here to play the waiting game i just genuinely love spending time with her and have gained some mutual friends out of knowing her as well. that being said, i‚Äôm starting to fall for her pretty hard. this doesnt take away from the times we hangout and how much fun we have, but its been starting to be on my mind more recently. as of now, my feelings arent strong enough to justify cutting her out, but the hourglass has definitely started. not so much looking for advice as i am insight. what would you do in my situation?


TLDR: was attracted to a girl in an unfulfilling long distance relationship. thought i could keep it platonic but am starting to catch feelings. almost certain she is into me as well, but is very insecure about leaving her bf. told her i would date her recently to see if the dynamic changes in the coming weeks",AskMen,1585552713,Lower_Bodybuilder,0,1,True,2020-03-30

Balls hurting - what gives?,"Okay so I‚Äôm not really looking for medical advice. About four days ago I did some body weight workout at home, had some sexy time with my wife at night. Next morning I felt some a pulse of pain in my right testicle so I thought maybe I was sleeping wrong, I adjusted my junk went back to sleep. It happened again a few minutes later. I immediately got up and tried to walk to it off. No severe pain. 

Throughout the day I felt slightly dull pain in my right ball. I thought maybe it was torsion but for some reason it wasn‚Äôt hurting when I inspected it with my fingers. No swelling no fever. I got in touch with a urologist who advised me to get on a antibiotic course for three days. Since I can‚Äôt really go out due to a lockdown for an ultrasound but give my symptoms he didn‚Äôt think it was too serious. 

I went to bed that night when I woke up next morning - my right testicle felt completely file but now I had similar dull pain in my left one. And it‚Äôs been there for three days now. I‚Äôm done with my antibiotics as well. 

When I‚Äôm walking around or laying around it‚Äôs almost zero. But when I‚Äôm sitting I can feel the dull ache. When lying down the pain sort of shifts to my lower left abdomen. If I push with my fingers on the lower abdomen right above the pelvic bone, there is some discomfort. 

Before all this started I was taking some diluted apple cider vinegar too stopped after the pain started. Not sure if it‚Äôs related. 

Anyway hoping to hear any ideas what could be it until I can get to a doctor.  

Thanks guys

Feeling Suicidal after losing all of my friends,"&amp;#x200B;

Im 25 and its been 7 years since high school. During that time I have made 0 new friends, and lost all of my old ones. I moved back to the state I spent in my childhood in, where the friends I made here stopped talking to me after I moved initially to escape going to an all male catholic school and live with my dad. I made a decent clique of friends when I moved to the south. We had a lot of good times, and I always had something to do in the weekends some days.

Moving here after losing everything since dropping out of college and ending up homeless, has been the most depressed Ive been since I left here. The people I used to hang out with here, barely even talk to me on facebook.

So here I am, sitting here alone on a Saturday night. I hate the bar, because I meet people, talk to them for a short time, and theyre gone. The only god damned good thing about me coming back is I got an IT certification and work as a tech in a job I hate yet (barely) pays the bills. None of my dreams have come true. I have no friends. I just for the first time in 10 years feel like putting a gun to my head or hanging myself. I mean I feel like such a pathetic piece of shit.  Im so fucking lonely it hurts. I've even considered joining the Army, just to do something with my life other than working, going to school in the evenings/online, exercising, and playing video games and being lonely. I even resorted to online dating and met a girl from Vietnam who I visited in person. Just, pathetic, in my eyes.

Do (most) men have an innate desire to *conquer* women?,"
Do (most) men really feel that women are meant to be conquered by men? As Ethan Klein from H3H3 suggested in a ‚Äúnature setting‚Äù.

‚ÄúWomen, in a nature setting are meant to be conquered.‚Äù 
Ethan Klein from H3H3 said in a podcast with Post Malone and Joji. At first I felt confused, and then I felt horrified.To give you some background first, I‚Äôm an  autistic woman who has survived sexual assault. Because I‚Äôm autistic i have trouble understanding things socially, but I also have a really good sense of what‚Äôs false and what‚Äôs not, aka seeing through lies.

This comment horrified me because while I am quite traditional in my beliefs of men and women, I‚Äôve never felt that women are meant to be ‚Äúconquered.‚Äù It disturbs me especially because when men have the mindset of wanting to conquer women, not pursue them or protect them but conquer them, it makes me wonder of the other ways they wish to conquer women.

"What to do when a guy wants a casual relationship, while I don't?","I met a guy a month ago; he is very charming, is a smooth talker and I can easily tell he isn't shy to flirt. He flirts heavily on texts and in person; I have chilled with him at my place, we watched movies, played video games and did a karaoke but nothing physical happened. 
I can easily tell he is showing interest in me; but there was something about him I couldn't point my finger at. Today while texting he mentioned he is looking for something casual, he also knows I am opposed to the idea. I am looking for a serious relationship and I am sure he is aware. 
He is definitely very attractive and pays a lot of attention to me (heavily on the physical part)
He sounds like bad news; I want to know if I should wait to see what he wants from me or should I be immediately cutting ties with him? 

P.S we have never officially been on a date. I was going to get pizza one Friday and he volunteered to see if I can use some company. We split the bill. You get the point now about this guy

I can't drive and don't have a car. My gf is a little bit bothered by this. Want to hear some opinions,"I posted this in r/relationship_advice. But i kinda want to hear opinions and perspective from this subreddit too.  


We're still in our early stage of relationship, we've only been together for 3 months (1 month of dating prior to that). And this is my first relationship so i dont rly hv much experience.

We live in a third world country where public transportation is not rly that good but its getting better especially after ride hailing apps (similar to Uber) are invented. So this has become the popular preference for ppl who dont have vehicle to go around the city. Ever since then, i've always think that car is not really a priority and necessary thing to buy now, at least not as necessary as it used to.

  
I've told her before when we're still dating when i feel like we're getting more serious that i don't have a car and last i drove a car is like 8 years ago but i do have license, i just dont have a car, and i cant even afford one if i want to. Even if i can afford it, it's really not my priority, i categorize it as a dumb purchase tbh bcs of the reason i stated above, i think something like house or at least apartment should be the priority, not car. She said she's fine with it.  


Things have been going great, she never said anything about this. We only spend time together once a week bcs both of us have jobs. When we go out, usually we met there and when it's time to go home, she will call a ride and i'll wait with her to take off first before i called mine, i thought that's the least i could do. And i thought its fine.

Yesterday is kinda our 3 months anniversary, and we talked about what we could hv done better for each other.

She brought this up. She said she like it when guys make an effort to do something for her. Ofc i asked like what, at this point i'm pretty sure i knew the answer alrdy. And i'm right, she specifically said like guys drive her home with their car (all her ex got car and always drove her home). She said that i've never even offer to call the ride for her (basically me paying for her ride, and order it using my phone instead of hers). I honestly feel like that's not even enough of an effort. So i told her how about that we go to her house together, and i'll go home from there. Which is a little bit ridiculous, bcs if we meet in the middle which we always do, that means i have to take a very long way to get back to mine. She said she's ok with that if i want to do that. I guess i can try to do that.  


So what i thought is no big deal before, is now kinda a big deal, and i cant stop thinking about this since yesterday. I sorta re-explained it to her my whole situation, how i dont see myself buying a car in the near future etc. But i have a feeling that this will come back and become a problem to us, to me.

talked to a girl i like for the first time. need help.,"about 2-3 months ago she smiled at me and always looks at me. even my friends say she looks when im not looking.


today my friend went up to her and said that i wanted to talk to her. i didnt have any conversation planned so it was awkward.

we both smiled, said hi, and shook hands. i asked her name and she told me her name. then we both were silent, i said thanks, and went away. 

after about a couple of seconds i said if it was okay that i was talking to her out of the blue, to which she said it's fine. i asked her if we can talk for 2 minutes, and she said what i wanna talk about. i said nothing and went away...

she wasnt frowning or anything, but smiling. the thing is she didnt even ask for my name which i think is a pretty bad sign. my friends told me that it's not necessarily a bad sign, and that happened to them too when they talked for the first time.

How to make things right after I slapped my best friend and ever since I feel like I'm dying inside every second?,"I'm a female and my best friend is a guy. 

We were going through a very difficult time. Our friendship was suffering already. He said some terrible stuff towards me. 

I had previously yelled at him and been very mean to him for saying he doesn't care about me. 


I love my best friend as a best friend and I know that he loves me as a best friend only. 


The problems began when His girlfriend told him not to talk to me because she was jealous of the attention being shared with anyone.

He fought with her for me. And things escalated sooo bad. He asked me to not talk to him for sometime till things get sorted between them. He said that because we work together. 

I'm at a bad place in life and have major depressions, anxiety and trust issues. He's one of the two people I have when I'm in my rock bottom. 

I broke down to a side I never knew that existed in me. I said his girlfriend should stop being jealous and get to know me. I told him, what he said makes me feel like I'm a man stealer, home wrecker.


That I trusted him and he broke it. He said he wanted to resolve but I said things in anger which can't be taken back only remorsed. I told him he's horrible to me and I don't want to be friends. 

Two days went, I regretted everything and apologized and did everything for him to see that I'm changed. There have incidents were fights have happened before ( where he was at fault and repented yelling or mistreatment) and he fought for us to stay best friends. 

When we're best friends, we are the best duo. People have envied our friendship and support system. It's not like we only run on fights. We disagree but always been there for eachother.
 
Then when we were going home together, we had a huge fight he yelled at me that he  no longer has a best friend  again and again and that I'll not be any part of his life anymore.

I slapped him. He left. I searched for him to apologise immediately but he was gone. I had fainted right after I realised and was helped by nearby people. 

I reached home and had completely forgotten about that day. I didn't even realise that I had forgotten about the day. It was like a mental block. 

 A week after I was angry that he was still fighting with me. He apologized for silly stuffs during work and I was oblivious to the torture I had put him through.

I confronted him today while going home and he said he won't go home with me. I asked why and he told me that day. Everything hit me at once and I can't believe what I have done. I hate myself as a human being.

I ran after him to apologise. He won't have any of it. I ran after him to tell him I am sorry. 

But stopped because he didn't want me to anymore. 


I have become a vile human. I don't deserve his friendship or kindness. Please help me live with being this pathetic person. I want to regret it. 

I lost my best friend today. I feel like I'm in purgatory. 


I'm sorry that he has to look at me everyday cuz of work. 

I'm sorry I broke what it means to be a human. 

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

I will apologize everyday I'm alive. I won't bother you. I won't ask you to be my best friend but you'll always be mine. I will love you always. We have been friends for a decade and I always thought we were the true example of friendship.


I'll hurt for you and hope that one day I'll be worthy of every having you as my best friend. 


I'm sorry.

Feel like flirting is considered too risky and inappropriate by alot of men nowerdays. I think it's kind of depressing . What do you guys think?,"I'm 21 m and I was speaking to a colleague in his early 60s. He was telling me how he doesn't know what's appropriate nowerdays. He was saying how when it comes to talking to women the whole dynamic has changed and become more complicated. I have to say I agree with him.

For example he asked me how I would flirt with a women in a club and how I would go about the whole situation. I wasn't sure what to tell him. I told him I'd usually gauge body language first then try have a dance with them or ideally strike up a conversation. I basically said what I say and how I act depends on how the women responds. I feel like this is the safest approach.

He said to me in his day things were much simpler and he could get away with being more forward. I find this fascinating and I envy this abit. I feel like I could relax more when talking to women if I didn't have to worry about sexual harassment or offending anyone. Obviously I wouldn't go around wanting to upset anyone in any circumstance. But it would be nice for example to have abit of a flirt with a women at work and be myself without have to worry about being fired.

Again don't get me wrong. I would never want to upset or creep anyone out. But I find it so fucking frustrating when for example complimenting a women is considered sexual harassment nowerdays if it doesn't want to be received. It's ridiculous. 

This all said I know there are alot of creepy ass guys out there who won't take a hint or come on too strong ect and to be honest it's probably them who ruined it in the first place.

Feel like flirting is considered too risky and inappropriate by alot of men nowerdays. I think it's kind of depressing . What do you guys think?,"I'm 21 m and I was speaking to a colleague in his early 60s. He was telling me how he doesn't know what's appropriate nowerdays. He was saying how when it comes to talking to women the whole dynamic has changed and become more complicated. I have to say I agree with him.

For example he asked me how I would flirt with a women in a club and how I would go about the whole situation. I wasn't sure what to tell him. I told him I'd usually gauge body language first then try have a dance with them or ideally strike up a conversation. I basically said what I say and how I act depends on how the women responds. I feel like this is the safest approach.

He said to me in his day things were much simpler and he could get away with being more forward. I find this fascinating and I envy this abit.

Should I allow my sister to smoke marijuana?,"My little sister, just turned 17, asked me if i have ever smoked marijuana before. Kinda curious as to why she randomly asked me such a question, I asked her why she asked. she responded by saying that some boy from school offered to give her a vape pen with weed oil, if she would go to junior prom with him. 

I responded by saying that the boy is just being dumb and that she shouldn't pay attention to him. to which she then added that her best friend has been experimenting with marijuana anyways, and offered to smoke with her alongside a few other friends from school. 

My sister continued by offering me a few options:

1. I smoke with her. Thus, her first time will be with someone trustworthy, and with experience in smoking.

2. She'll go smoking anyways with her best friend and a bunch of their friends from school, which are mostly boys.

So now i'm thinking, that one way or the other she will be exposed to marijuana. Whether it is now or some time in the near future. If I make a big deal out of this and straight up reject her decision, she will go and do it anyways. If I consult with our parents forget it, she'll never forgive me for ""snitching"" for as long as I live. continuing on that possibility, should my parents find out and reprimand her, it will only give her that much of a bigger reason to smoke. Out of pettiness, resentment and rebellion towards my parents. I know my sister very well. 

I decided on smoking with her for her first time and guide her through the process of what is she really doing. I feel like if her first time is with her friends, they""ll just try to peer pressure her into smoking more than she could handle.

"How long does it take you to confidently say, ""Yep I really like this girl.""","2 weeks? A month? I met a girl a just before New Years. We went on a few dates, talked on the phone a bunch, snapchated, told jokes, kissed even. In the matter of about a month I fell for this woman so hard. Like wanted to actually date her. Unfortunately because of our jobs it would be very problematic if that were to happen and we got caught. She had more to lose and I understand her hesitation. Last weekend I had to call her and tell her we can't talk anymore. She couldn't date me and I wasn't going to try to be just friends with someone I was so romantically interested in. I know myself and it is emotionally debilitating. Why am I still thinking about her? Why do I feel like crap even though I knew this would be the outcome. I feel weird that I only knew her for 6 weeks and I feel like this. Do I just need to give it time to forget her?

"Not sure where else to put this, but I have a foreskin question.","This is my first time ever talking about my foreskin (28/m) and I have some questions. 

Growing up I‚Äôve never had any issue with sex, it retracts when sex occurs with no issues. Throughout the day, my foreskin is up. I think it used to be a little tight but now it‚Äôs not bad. I can clean it and what not in the shower but it‚Äôs still really sensitive when the foreskin is down. 

Here‚Äôs the kicker, about 5 days ago I got a REALLY bad hand job. I think it made my foreskin really lose to the point where if I‚Äôm walking around and I got an erection, my foreskin rolls down on its own and it makes it really uncomfortable to walk around since it rubs against my boxers and it‚Äôs very sensitive. While flaccid it‚Äôs okay for the most part but sometimes it goes back on its own while flaccid as well. I feel like if I flex my penis enough it just goes back. 

What advice does anyone have regarding this situation? Do I just tough it out? Does it get better? How do I make my penis go back to how it was before the awful hand job üò≠

On multiple occasions he spat in my face, and a handful of times it became physical. Anything I did would set him off. I had to tip toe around our 750sqft apartment just so I didn‚Äôt piss him off. I was his verbal punching bag for him to unload his lifetime of failures, shortcomings and insecurities onto.

Also, I never get this feeling on any other part of the body, even scratching the itchiest of itches, only my balls. I really have no idea why this happens, and it doesn‚Äôt happen very often.

Is this girl still interested in me?,"well shit... I'm not sure whether this is the right thing to do but fuck it help me out, guys.

Lately, I've been confused about this girl im 19 and shes 18. We've both been friends for a long time. There was never anything romantic between us in the beginning. However, around December 2018, I started joking with her about how i wanted to cuff her and date her at first it was a joke and we both talked about it and agreed upon having a thing together and decided to go on date. Which to my surprise was not awkward one bit it actually felt natural i held her hand, she laid on my chest during the movie and we talked and were having a great time. After this date, we started talking more and went on more dates together. Before I knew it I started catching feelings for and we started sending each other cute messages and we spent valentines together where I made my move to kiss her and all I gotta say wow she was blushing and i just felt so happy but eventually around February my dumbass decided to ask her what we were she proceeded telling me that we were a thing but we were kinda dating but without the title meaning, we couldn't be talking to other people (I should mention that before any of this happened, she had recently gotten out of a toxic relationship). Well after this conversation things between me and her started going bad and I decided to end it with her before one of us really got hurt which was the biggest mistake of my life cause, in the end, I ended up hurting my own self and im pretty sure I ended up hurting her feelings. 

after this, I realized that I made the biggest mistake and i tried fixing things with her but unfortunately she didn't want to open up to me again. I spent the entire 2019 year being depressed and honestly, I don't know about you guys but 2019 was such an ass of a year. I spent most of the year unable to sleep because I couldn't get her out of my mind and what made it worse is that while I was out visiting family in Guatemala I came back and found out that my friend had done something with her but I'm not even sure what happened cause at first he told me that did stuff with her which really broke me but I couldn't believe him because she's not the type of girls who give it up that easily, in fact, she told me that she wanted to wait till marriage and that why she broke up with a lot of her boyfriends cause they all just wanted to fuck her. Me and my friend fought and he finally ended up telling me that he was joking and they didn't do anything he just kissed her for a few seconds causes she was like nahh im not easy like that. (bruhh honestly as im writing this im not even sure what i want)

Well as the year went by the pain slowly went away and I started enjoying being single again and honestly, I've finally reached a point in my life where I'm happy by myself and have reached a point where I know that I deserve better than her. but recently my friend convinced me to start texting her again since its the new year 2020 and we haven't talked much but honestly, I don't really feel it anymore with her but there is a tiny part of me that wants to try again even tho I know that I'm not vibing with her like I used to. First of all, I can't really tell whether she is interested I think she may be but it's hard to tell by the way she texts. She a person that is dry texter and she has always been like this from the beginning even when we had our thing together. Also, it's not so easy to hang out with her cause she recently has entered school again and she plays in the soccer team which means she gets home late and having Hispanic parents makes it even way more difficult for me to hang out with her cause they don't allow me to be out late and fuck the weekends are also hard cause she serves at my church so and on Saturdays, I work with my dad. Also, I'm soon gonna start school which sucks cause I'm gonna be coming home late since all my classes end around 8 or 9 pm. The only thing that makes me think that she is interested is that she sometimes uses smiling emojis with her texts. For example when she says goodnight she usually sends it like this ""goodnight :)"" or ""Goodmorning :)"".

She a person that is dry texter and she has always been like this from the beginning even when we had our thing together. Also, it's not so easy to hang out with her cause she recently has entered school again and she plays in the soccer team which means she gets home late and having Hispanic parents makes it even way more difficult for me to hang out with her cause they don't allow me to be out late and fuck the weekends are also hard cause she serves at my church so and on Saturdays, I work with my dad. Also, I'm soon gonna start school which sucks cause I'm gonna be coming home late since all my classes end around 8 or 9 pm. The only thing that makes me think that she is interested is that she sometimes uses smiling emojis with her texts. For example when she says goodnight she usually sends it like this ""goodnight :)"" or ""Goodmorning :)"". Bruhh honestly I don't even know if I even like her at this point or whether she likes me so can yall do your thing and help me out.",AskMen,1579063725,idest247,0,1,True,2020-01-14

"If you had braces when younger, do you still wear a retainer?","If yes, how long have you been wearing it for? If no, have your teeth shifted noticeably? 

I personally had ""permanent"" retainers for 12 years post braces and finally got them off because I was tired of the difficulty with flossing. The ortho gave me clear removable retainers as a replacement. But the prospect of wearing those gross things a few nights a week for LIFE just seemed rather crazy to me. I decided to do an experiment and say screw it, I'm going to stop this and see what my teeth do on their own. 1.5 years later, there is some slight shifting but nothing too bad.

How to last longer in bed and how to gain confidence in approaching girls as a brown guy? I know this post has been answered multiple times but I want to just give a little more context.,"I am 26 year old Indian guy in the US and have had one white girlfriend and we broke up amicably (because of different dreams and moving to different cities etc). But while being with her I realized that I dont last for long (sometimes lesser than 3 minutes) (and since you know about the Indian size, we need to make up in time for the lack in size). There were times I knew she wasn't happy, she would understand the issue but then again who wants to be with that guy.

I believe this has been clearly due to bad masturbation practices (for the lack of the right word) like skipping to the part doing ""it"" for less than a minute and getting it over with, which I believe, is one of the major reasons for the not lasting in bed.Now, since that time it has taken a lot of toll on my confidence not only in bed with others but also in approaching girls thinking that if I get lucky I will be just embarrassed at the end. This has resulted in me approaching literally zero girls in 2019 (yes that means I havent got sex in 2019 which kinda sucks balls). I am hoping to make amends for 2020 and hopefully have a better year.

So now the question is: how to undo the wrong things of the past and have a better future? How to get more confidence against things like this which is in my head and stopping me from approaching girls!

Girl B is (imo) drop dead gorgeous, wears tasteful but still stylish clothes, doesn't get too crazy with the drinks, and comes across super confident and put together (but not to the point of being a narcissist or unapproachable, she is like super sweet and cool) yet not a lot of guys ever really talk to her.

How do I stop wanting to contact my ex?,"Kind of a creepy question huh? I assure readers that nothing creepy has gone on and no unwanted contact (after a couple of texts I mention below) has been made.

I dated a girl for a couple of months a while ago, fell head over heels for her. We worked together but fortunately I changed jobs shortly after we started dating. She broke it off a month later; oh well, boo hoo (I was crushed but oh well). As far as separations go it was friendly (we were never officially together). I texted her a couple of times a few weeks after, see how she was. No reply, so I let it go.

It's been a year and a half since we stopped dating. I still have friends at my old job, so we both hear about each other every now and then, but don't see each other. It took me a year to get over this 2 month relationship, but I've finally moved on, doing well at my current job (even promoted recently), and am doing well personally, finally.

My problem is, I have a hard time letting go of people, especially people I was romantically involved with. Almost every day since, I've wanted to text her. I'm on speaking or even friendly terms with all of my ex's except 2. I don't contact the 2 because obviously, but the desire to, especially for this most recent girl, doesn't go away. I've spoken to my therapist about it but she doesn't have a straight answer.

Mine isn't just a situation where you just look up an ex on Instagram or Facebook out of curiosity. I want to talk to her again. Is there some way to make these feelings stop? To not want to contact an ex?

I want to reiterate, she made it clear by not responding that she wasn't interested in a friendship, so I did not contact her again.",AskMen,1579067830,PM_YOUR_LADY_BOOB,4,1,True,2020-01-14

However that didn't last too long.. A month later I'm back to being a bit like I used to. I felt like it was due to the fact that I had come back to certain lifestyle routines that were stressful and affected my mental state (to the old state).

&gt; [Feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist ""Feminist"") views of the depiction of male-on-female facials are primarily critical. Sociologists [Gail Dines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Dines ""Gail Dines""), [Robert Jensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_W._Jensen ""Robert W. Jensen"") and Russo echo these sentiments in the book _Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality_. It asserts ""In pornography, ejaculating onto a woman is a primary method by which she is turned into a slut, something (not really someone) whose primary, if not only, purpose is to be sexual with men.""[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_(sex_act)#cite_note-21) Radical feminist and noted critic of pornography [Andrea Dworkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Dworkin ""Andrea Dworkin"") said ""it is a convention of pornography that the sperm is on her not in her. It marks the spot, what he owns and how he owns it. The ejaculation on her is a way of saying (through showing) that she is contaminated with his dirt; that she is dirty.


&gt; [Gail Dines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Dines ""Gail Dines""), writing in _Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality_, describes the money shot of a man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman as ""one of the most degrading acts in porn"".[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_(sex_act)#cite_note-Dines2010xxiv-23) To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer's body ""marks the woman as used goods"", conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer [Bill Margold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Margold ""Bill Margold"") as saying, ""I'd like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. I firmly believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have.""[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_(sex_act)#cite_note-Dines2010xxiv-23) She adds that at least for some posters on adult forums discussing such scenes, the pleasure is derived from watching a woman suffer.",AskMen,1579071357,lynne-koffman,1,1,True,2020-01-14

We worked together where originally he was my coworker and later my manager, we originally weren't on bad terms yet he started trying to creepily flirt and I don't like flirty behaviour in general especially from ugly coworkers. When he started this behaviour I felt as if something was wrong with him so I distanced myself from him where I was still formal at work, but didn't really engage or talk to him that much anymore; he even joked 'did we break up?' Which ultimately became a darker comment down the line.

At my house I found mens shoe prints in the yard and felt as if I was being watched, I talked to people and it was sort of chalked up to me being ""paranoid"" because I lived alone, I also lived on a main street where drunk people would occasionally stumble through the yard or sleep in the garden bed so I tried to rationalise it as something else. As time went on I would hear sounds outside or phone noises that I tried to dismiss as someone going by the house, meanwhile the guy was asking me mysteriously coincidental questions about things in my house and I usually ignored him because it was irrelevant to work and he can fuck off.

Then the phone calls started where I was getting annoying and constant phone calls on a private number where the person just breathed into the phone, because it was near tax season I dismissed it as telemarketing scams where they test your number. During the time the guy was switching between being really mean then friendly and joking towards me, we would have arguments more like a relationship issue rather than work conflict and he would apologise more as if we had a lovers tiff rather than disagreement ex: there was an item missing and I asked him if he's seen it somewhere, he turns around it makes it a personal argument saying I accuse him of moving things and I tell him if he's going to throw tantrums like this I do not want to talk to him unless its work related, later he would start moping near me saying he's sorry very pitifully then acted as if we are making up instead of talking more professionally.

One night I came home someone had been in the house so I contacted the police and they implied I was probably imagining it. Later I found something that greatly resembled semen on my front door then it rained so I tried to rationalise it being bird poo or something instead. The guy's behaviour was becoming more and more bizarre while stuff at my house was becoming wild. It then escalated from watching to him actually wanting me to see him; he showed up in my bedroom window and living room window. When I contacted the police they said there was lack of evidence (the police took like 40 minutes to arrive) then basically did nothing.

At work he tried to be cheeky and ask me how I slept, I told him I slept well and pretended I didn't see him lurking around the house despite the fact he and I were staring right at each other. He got angry. I got cameras and only partly caught him in the yard walking along the house. I later found out he was watching me sleep, change my clothes, and he went into the house and masturbated in/on things. I made the mistake of trying to deal with the situation by myself hence I confronted him so he tried to intimidate me by standing over me, grabbing items off me, mimicking me, hiding behind places trying to scare me, placing his stuff with mine, and at some stage cornered me which had me standing sideways away from him while he breathed onto my neck (so fucking vile) muttering trash until someone found us and he immediately backed off. He stalked me for an estimate of 10 months working out my routine and watching me for hours.

However he also did all my work tasks then tried to causally say goodbye to me. During the stalking period he would switch between being snide and mean to again friendly, try get us alone and would constantly lurk around me, acted as if I was garbage while seeking my approval, if I said something like 'good morning' he would use that as an excuse to immediately beeline towards me, he would fixate on my hair, accuse me of ""telling him what to do"" when I was not ex: we were sitting together at break time and he told me he was leaving so i said 'ok bye' then he declares 'I'm not leaving now because you can't tell me what to do!' I was like ????, implied I was being sexual when I was not ex: I was cleaning out equipment which required me to bend and go slightly inside the machine so I basically i had my ass out to do it, it wasn't to be sexy it was to do my job and he marched out at me accusing me of being suggestive, would be possessive of my stuff, I told him I don't like people touching me so he would constantly try touch me in a way that was just under the radar to get him in trouble at work ex: touching my arm, ""accidentally"" brushing over my back, standing in my space, etc. 

I'm not that attractive, am over weight (l'm losing weight), people think I'm almost prudish so there was nothing physical or behaviours that I can see as appealing, while I made it very clear I found him creepy and annoying. I also cannot comprehend why some guy with options would prefer to stalk someone who doesn't even like him risking job and reputation to do it. I didn't stick around to find out his end game and he isn't stupid enough to message or contact me over this stuff.

I just do not understand why he would do this or why he would even fixate. There was nothing there to provoke this.",AskMen,1577761332,Dont_Key_Cars,15,1,True,2019-12-30

"Why is there such a stark difference between how guys manage emotional situations, particularly with mates, versus how girls do?","I never thought about it until I moved into a new place and started working and made friends with a number of girls.


Prior, I'd always been friends with guys by majority (I had one female best friend and a group of guys at HS) and I guess I became a bit like them. No one discussed emotions or how each other was going and the conversations were superficial on an emotional level. I never learnt to ask how people were feeling and going and just kept things to myself if I was having a rough time.


Fast forward to last year, I dropped off a guy I knew from class and his mates at a club and one of his mates was clearly having a rough time and the alcohol had caused him to open up.
He had been mistreated by a girl that he really cared about and she'd been taunting him.
He kept trying to discuss it but the guy I *knew* (emphasis on *knew* bc he is a jerk) and his other mate were laughing about it and demeaning the situation and posting videos of themselves whilst the guy was clearly upset in the background captioned ""drunk mates be like"" which I saw when I got home.


At the time I didn't think much about it even though I wanted to hug the guy but thinking back it sickens me that that sort of culture exists and that they thought it was all stupid and a joke. I also kick myself for not stepping in (I'm sorry whoever you were).


Anyway, this year I moved in with a group of girls and experienced something I never had before. A caring and nurturing environment. If someone was upset they would sit with them and hug them and they'd often ask how I was going and were very open and understanding about mental health issues. It made me more compassionate too and I treated people.


So when I noticed a guy upset at work the other day (he's normally outgoing and loves to joke around and he was flat and quiet) I picked up on it and took over what he was doing so he could have a break. After we'd finished I sat with him and although it took him a while to stop being tough and indenial, I sat with him and we talked and I put my arm around him for support.


Afterwards he sent me a message that it really meant a lot to have someone care in that way and that it was really sweet of me to do so which made me wonder if this was an unusual occurrence in his life for him to make such a big deal over it when it seemed normal for me.


Why is there such a divide in the way both genders handle emotional and tough situations with their friends in this day and age? It really makes me mad.",AskMen,1577763934,iwtara0214,623,1,True,2019-12-30

"Have you experienced decrease in your libido after your LT relationship ended? If so, how did you overcome it?","I have always been someone with high libido. But ever since my breakup something is not right. I am not going to bore you with the details of the breakup, let's just say it was not nice.

It has been about 4 months now, the first 2.5-3 months I was doing okay. But a month ago I reached out because all of the negative feelings were washed away and I was feeling sad. She just murdered me with her words. She was clear, direct and precise. Like someone I never knew. She said that she didn't have feelings for me anymore. That's when the break up hit me.

After that I just lost my sexual desire. I don't even want to masturbate. I hooked up with few people, but it's just off. Even my penis feels weird. It use to be a lot firmer even when flaccid. Now it just chills there like some old dude trying to sleep.

It seems like the obvious answer is to go out to a local bar and try and meet people, but I feel like NYE would be one of the more difficult nights to do that. Along with that I'm just nervous about my first real experience going out in this new city will end up being me drinking alone at a bar surrounded by people celebrating the new year.

I would socially classisfy myself as the type of person that doesn't have problems talking to people but having difficulty making the first step to engage. I also don't actually start my job for a week so I don't know anyone from work yet. The alternative to this would probably be to just see if any of my online friends are around.

"If you were alone for the holidays, how would you feel if a friend reached out / wanted to go do something with you?","I'm unsure if my friend brings up being alone for the new year as a sign of wanting to go do something or if it's stating as a matter of fact?

Yesterday, a friend of mine said his family (scatter across the states) and his SO (for work) are out of town and won't see them until Friday. I'm a ""planner"" according to my own friends, who are more reserved than I, and the onus feels like its on me to suggest something, indirectly. I kinda tire of being the initiator, as we're both reserved, I get told a lot that he appreciates me attempting to get him out of his shell ""thanks for the invite but... (I'm busy/got plans/not feeling up to it/maybe next time).""

He usually doesn't mention things he'll be up to do barring trips to exotic lands like Bali/Vanuatu/etc. and I always kinda feel like he is just putting up with me to some extent since we're quiet but he puts his headphones away and walks on over to me when at a 24hr to chitchat and whatnot, rather than leave them in (like he used to do initially, so he has warmed up to me).

I dunno if I should suggest doing something, only if he'd like to, since I myself have no plans (and my immediate family flies in on the 1st) and plan to treat it like any other day. I've been invited to some small parties with cousins and I've done a few but barring the host, I wouldn't know anyone else and I generally feel uncomfortable with a large number of strangers.

---

tl;dr: my friend has both his fianc√© + family out of town for New Years. Wondering if are hinting they want to do something with me, but I kinda 'tire' of always being the one on to suggest to do shit together (innocuous shit like play pool, grab a bite). Only reason I ask despite the declines is a LPT (I can't link it) to ""keep inviting that friend who always says no"". I guess I have social anxiety but I also get demoralized after constantly trying (once in a blue moon).",AskMen,1577777298,stethoscopemeplease,20,1,True,2019-12-30

18F how would you react to my kink?,"to get to the point: i have a sneezing fetish. 

i‚Äôve felt weird about sneezes/noses since i was a young child and i cannot get rid of this fetish no matter how much i want to. i can literally get horny watching a guy rub his nose. 

my sexual fantasy is a guy sneezing uncontrollably, possibly into my chest, possibly with bondage involved. the idea of feeling a guy‚Äôs body shaking and seeing him in such a vulnerable state is such a turn on to me. plus a pre-sneeze face/heavy breathing is similar to a pre-orgasm face/heavy breathing if you think about it. i‚Äôd also like to lick a guy‚Äôs nose. 

i‚Äôve never been in a relationship before because i‚Äôm waiting for the right person, but i‚Äôm scared that when i finally am in one and reveal my fetish, my boyfriend will be grossed out by me. 

i‚Äôve been told by several girl friends that my fetish is tame and that they don‚Äôt think any guy would be bothered by it, but i have yet to receive any opinions from a guy. thoughts? would this be a dealbreaker for you?

How do i learn who i am?,"So i was listening to alan watts (an amazing philosopher, id would suggest him to anyone in a heart beat) and something that was mentioned is that in all honesty, if you dont know what you want there are two options, you either already have it, or dont know your self, and thinking on it more and more i realize how little of myself i really know, and im really clammed up in my own view of the world that i never sit and take it all in. I never take in the other stuff of the world that makes me feel safe or at home or anything, i really feel like im going through each day, never learning or growing. Ive thought to myself just.. How do i learn who i am? I love playing the flute but am unsure how to grow with it, i love to sit outside and be with my animals but am always miss guided by emotions and judgement and often never do it, i think its relaxing to sit and watch tv or play a game but get so absorbed that i forget my world around me and get lost in something that will never allow me to grow.

It's been a few days and we haven't texted since, but I think she's pretty cool, and I'd like to be her friend.

I just don't know how to express that across a text message without it being weird (Especially since, it's been a few days).

I caught feelings for my best friend who is moving away and this helplessness is killing me,"So I‚Äôve become really close to this guy over the past 6-7 months and we chat through out the day, send snaps, give wake up calls and every happening in life.
As much as I‚Äôve become closer to this person and he feels like home tbh, it‚Äôs weird when I say we met on tinder. 
However, it never seemed so weird while talking to him or when around him. About 3 months ago, he told me he‚Äôs not looking to date someone when I put out that I‚Äôm considering the option to date him. I felt really bad but he made sure we continued to stay in touch. In fact, our bond grew stronger after that. He became my best friend, therapist and go-to person for any single happening in my life. 
What confuses me is how his attitude changes whenever I bring up the topic of chatting with some other dude on random networking sites. He blatantly ignores or changes the topic or visibly puts efforts to make a joke out of it. 
I‚Äôve told him I kinda him and whenever he makes jokes about how I‚Äôm still single or jealous of his friends, it hurts me very very much. 
I convinced myself that I‚Äôm craving companionship and fooled myself that I like him cuz he‚Äôs the best friend and it‚Äôs so easy with him. 
But with every passing day, I realise how much I like him. I‚Äôve caught feelings for him but I can‚Äôt express that.  Honestly, it‚Äôs breaking my heart and I‚Äôm crying myself to sleep every night.
He‚Äôs leaving to a different country for masters in 2 weeks and I don‚Äôt even know if we‚Äôll ever meet again. But he promises to stay in touch and share his uni experiences.
It‚Äôs just killing me to see myself being affected by a single person so much but being helpless about it cuz I can‚Äôt lose his friendship.

Advice: Dating my co-worker,"\*Thow away account for reasons\* 

So. I ( 30s f )started dating a guy (42m) I work with.. Yes.. I know.. ""Don't do it"" but we did.. It's been going on for almost 4 months. He is not my superior, but we work closely together. 

When we first started this whole thing, I was getting out of a bizarre  5 yr engagement that I had checked out of long ago. (We were more room mates than anything toward the end. I did not cheat) \*Not physically cheat.. maybe some emotional?\*

 I had already mourned the loss of my relationship and was ready to move on. 

When we first started this thing he said he wanted to ""serious date"" me and I was ""his girl"". 

Recently he called his friend in front of me and said ""I'm staying at my friend thowaway521 place, the girl I told you I've been dating for a few months"".  When he got off the phone he made a comment to me about how should I be glad he told his friend about me weeks ago... 

I literally have no idea what this means. Is it time to put of some barriers? Am I a friend w/ benefits or the girl he is dating.. I have no idea. 

My problem is I tend to be a bit emotional, caught the feels and blurted that I loved him. I KNOW. FUCK ME. He cuddled and said he liked me.. I get it.. super soon.

WTF?," Crossposted on r/relationships

So.. I ( late 30s f )started dating a guy ( Early 40's m) I work with.. Yes.. I know.. ""Don't do it"" but we did.. It's been going on for almost 4 months. He is not my superior, but we work closely together.

When we first started this whole thing, I was getting out of a bizarre 5 yr engagement that I had checked out of long ago. (We were more room mates than anything toward the end. I did not cheat)

I should add.. he apparently had no idea I was even with someone. He was a bit reserved. Literally everyone else in the office knew. Still trying to figure out how he didn't? It was not a secret. Weird.

I had already mourned the loss of my relationship and was ready to move on.

When we first started this thing he said he wanted to ""serious date"" me and I was ""his girl"".

Then I made the mistake of catching the feels.. we went for dinner and drinks and I busted out with ""the L word"" I messed up. I'm on the super emotional side of the spectrum and I know I messed up. But now it's out there.

Recently he called his friend in front of me and said ""I'm staying at my friend xemphere's place, the girl I told you I've been dating for a while"". When he got off the phone he made a comment to me about how should I be glad he told his friend about me weeks ago...

I literally have no idea what this means. Is it time to put of some barriers? Am I a friend w/ benefits or the girl he is dating.. I have no idea.

I hope I'm not sounding super teen-agey.. but I've literally never encountered this.

Boyfriend needing space and me giving him the space he asked for: wondering a mans perspective on it,"What do other dudes think about this

My boyfriend has trust issues that are family rooted, and its his first time being in love, but he loves me and his actions for sure speak louder than words. 
He was willing to be vulnerable enough with me to tell me he needs space, and also let me know in multiple different ways he didn‚Äôt want to break up with me. So. I said take a month max and then we‚Äôll check in. I‚Äôm not worried about it and I trust him a lot to do the reflection he asked for in this space. We just transitioned into long distance so we haven‚Äôt talked since we said goodbye irl.

"For those of you that have relocated to a new state, how did you find/create a new group of friends?","As the title states, I moved to my new home last year and so far have adjusted well to the city, nightlife and essentially, my new life. 

I have had a great time exploring the city, restaurants and going out with my wife, but the thing that I find I am lacking is my own group of friends. After moving here, I was so wrapped up in work that my social life took a back seat to everything but was able to befriend my wife‚Äôs friends and their husbands as well in the meantime. They have all been so kind in including me whenever there is an event, social outings, etc. but they have all known each other for 10+ years and also have their own circles of friends who I will be the first to admit that I have a hard time fitting in (or at least feeling like it) due to a lot of differences in personalities; not in a bad way, but they are the types of people that I would mingle with at a bar for a night and then afterwards, not think much of it.

Now that I am used to my work schedule and have time to socialize, I am missing my friends back at home who I have been friends with since high school and am finding it difficult to find a social group of my own.

"Am I a Friend or ""his girl""?","So. I ( late 30s f )started dating a guy ( Early 40's m) I work with.. Yes.. I know.. ""Don't do it"" but we did.. It's been going on for almost 4 months. He is not my superior, but we work closely together.

When we first started this whole thing, I was getting out of a bizarre 5 yr engagement that I had checked out of long ago. (We were more room mates than anything toward the end. I did not cheat)

I should add.. he apparently had no idea I was even with someone. He was a bit reserved. Literally everyone else in the office knew. Still trying to figure out how he didn't? It was not a secret. Weird.

I had already mourned the loss of my relationship and was ready to move on.

When we first started this thing he said he wanted to ""serious date"" me and I was ""his girl"".

Then I made the mistake of catching the feels.. we went for dinner and drinks and I busted out with ""the L word"" I messed up. I'm on the super emotional side of the spectrum and I know I messed up. But now it's out there.

Recently he called his friend in front of me and said ""I'm staying at my friend xemphere's place, the girl I told you I've been dating for a while"". When he got off the phone he made a comment to me about how should I be glad he told his friend about me weeks ago...

I literally have no idea what this means. Is it time to put of some barriers? Am I a friend w/ benefits or the girl he is dating.. I have no idea.

I hope I'm not sounding super teen-agey.. but I've literally never encountered this.

Why do some men orbit girls?,"Context: I met a guy when I was a senior in high school. He seemed awesome and caring in the beginning. He did, however, have a bit of an issue with our age gap. We lost touch for a bit. I graduated college and he came back into my life like he never left. We got along and everything was good for a while until he found the next girl and walked away. I forced myself to forget about him until I started law school and he came back. He actually started making an effort and got jealous when I was out with men, but whenever I tried to get him to commit to a relationship with me, he acted like there was nothing between us. I have stopped all contact again and will probably never talk to him again even if he tries to come back because I‚Äôm sick of it. So why do men orbit? Why do they feel the need to come back after losing touch and then leaving when they feel like they‚Äôve lost the rush of playing cat and mouse? Sorry for the rant.

"Married/LTR men, how do you really feel about your partner's body after it's been through some shit?","I've been with my guy for 8 years and due to getting comfortable/matching some of his eating habits, switching to a sedentary job, and experiencing some rough health issues, I gained about 80lbs from when he first met me. The last year I've been taking my health seriously and lost 68 of those since January. 


I feel pretty good about myself (BMI of 24 feels great after being fat for years) while clothed, but naked? Man. There's a lot of damage. Some like stretch marks are whatever. But I also had my son 11 years ago and now that I'm skinny again you can really tell. (I've got a several inches thick mother's apron, if you're familiar.) There's also additional loose skin on my thighs and hips, and a little on my arms, and my boobs are a little saggier. 


It's tough, because I just DO NOT look at all like the women with beautiful bodies of a similar size as me, and I'm painfully aware of that. I've still got some decent curves (a little waist and a big round bum, nice proportions) but mainly being naked leaves me feeling pretty ugly.


As for my partner, he insists that I have been extremely desirable to him the whole time, fat, skinny, loose skin, whatever. I believe him (no sex life issues, he still likes to get me naked, get nudes from me, compliments, is crazy affectionate) so I'm not worried about that. But I wonder what's really going on in his head. Is it just love that makes him think I am sexy?


Obviously, it would be great if you all told me that your women are still gorgeous and desirable to you, but I want to know the whole truth. Do you wish your woman had that perfect, perky body, even just a little bit? Does it matter at all? Do you still think she's gorgeous? Is it a huge issue in your attraction towards her?

(Serious) How can I have healthier relationships with women?,"
27 male here.
Growing up, I never had healthy relationships with women. I had my mom (single mother household), but I never had any friendships with girls.

Middle/High School I felt alienated by everyone. I was already shy/introverted and had very little clue how to relate to anybody. I always framed girls in the context of sexual attraction. 

During college, I went through a heavy religious phase. (Born again Christian) and it contextualized how I saw a lot of women again. However I still saw them as sexual objects, just in more subtle ways. The Madonna/Whore complex was in full effect. I also saw mixed messages about guys interacting with women. As cringy as this sounds, I couldnt separate the idea of them as the ultimate fulfillment of my male identity. It seemed like real men were able to attract a wife. There was an unhealthy marriage culture there. I also felt sexually repressed in a lot of ways.


Having broken from that religious faith identity, my view of women has much *much* improved, but I still have to do a double take when a woman smiles at me. I have to question in my mind if she's interested in *me* or the conversation. It sucks, but the way that I see women is still contextualized in a sexual way-- just in a much less abrasive way than before.

It's often hard for me to simply shoot the breeze with women that I find attractive. I can hang out with guys fine, but if I find any woman attractive it's like my brain works hard to try to find ways to impress her.

Funnily enough, this tendency dies when I find out that they have a boyfriend. So it's like as long as my brain thinks that I have a romantic chance with them, it overloads.

I've seen my guy friends interact nonchalantly with attractive women before.

How can I simply just see them as people and not romantic conquests?

Intellectually, I know that women do not exist to affirm my male identity, but belief wise...it's like my emotions still believe it.",AskMen,1573888420,Hkr0067,5,1,True,2019-11-15

I became a tough guy in highschool, got married, became a cop, marriage fell apart. I'm kinda world weary and i've kept my heart far from love. 

I meant a girl who I regularly had to work with. She was just my type in every way. Cute, reader, melloncholly, very sweet, ect. For months we were friends and we just clicked super well and were great friends.


A couple months in she begins to flirt with me a lot. Before I knew it I had feelings for her. We both flirted and teased, something was different about her, it made my walls I built up fall down, I told her several times, that I'm not a player, she is the only girl I talk to like this, and that was special to her. She told me that I was special to her, the way we spoke to each other was, and she would be jelice if I did go after other girls. I was in a place where I was not ready for a relationship, she knew that and we established that we were just friends, but then we went back to flirting and I told her she was special to me, and she knew I wanted her


Some weeks she seemed really into me, some weeks she did not, it confused me how week we were enamored and the next she almost didn't have interest in me . We snap chatted and she started to send me borderline sexual vids. I talked to her and told her plainly about me feelings for her, that before it goes further I want to know she felt the same. She said that she did not and never had. She said that we discussed that we were just friends and blamed me for not over looking into what she said to me. She said she likes the fun we were having and wants to keep up what were doing. She said she thinks I'm super good looking, great personality, ect and that she wants to have fun with me. I told her that words mean things, you told me that what you and I have is special, that you always wanted me with you, I told you I am only doing all this because it's real to me. She blamed me still, I was pretty heart broken, and she had 0 sympathy, not slightly bothered that I was truly hurt, even all the times I comforted her. This was not just some girl I wanted to sleep with. She made me feel loved, wanted, all these things I didn't realize I haven't felt I'm so long. It was the first time in years I really opened my jaded and world weary heart up. I told her we are not continuing this, we can be friendly, but I'm not going to get carried away with you.

A few friends of mine guys and a girl told me to not go for her. She is kind of a mess. She had an affair and could be a flirt. A female friend like a sister to me had told me that she sounds like a manipulator, saying she knew what she was doing and blamed me for everything.

She told me that I was special to her, the way we spoke to each other was, and she would be jelice if I did go after other girls. I was in a place where I was not ready for a relationship, she knew that and we established that we were just friends, but then we went back to flirting and I told her she was special to me, and she knew I wanted her

Some weeks she seemed really into me, some weeks she did not, it confused me how week we were enamored and the next she almost didn't have interest in me . Some months went by, We snap chatted and she started to send me borderline sexual vids. I talked to her and told her plainly about me feelings for her, that before it goes further I want to know she felt the same. She said that she did not and never had. She said that we discussed that we were just friends and blamed me for not over looking into what she said to me. She said she likes the fun we were having and wants to keep up what were doing. She said she thinks I'm super good looking, great personality, ect and that she wants to have fun with me. I told her that words mean things, you told me that what you and I have is special, that you always wanted me with you, I told you I am only doing all this because it's real to me. She blamed me still, I was pretty heart broken, and she had 0 sympathy, not slightly bothered that I was truly hurt, even all the times I comforted her. This was not just some girl I wanted to sleep with. She made me feel loved, wanted, all these things I didn't realize I haven't felt I'm so long. It was the first time in years I really opened my jaded and world weary heart up. I told her we are not continuing this, we can be friendly, but I'm not going to get carried away with you.

A few friends of mine guys and a girl told me to not go for her. She is kind of a mess. She had an affair and could be a flirt. A female friend like a sister to me had told me that she sounds like a manipulator, saying she knew what she was doing and blamed me for everything. It makes sense what they are saying. it's just, I still feel fucked up, was it all just a lie? I just can't believe I opened my heart up for the first time in many years and this happened.

How do you deal with a close friend unexpectedly leaving you?,"So I've been at my current job for a little over two years now. In that entire time I only had one genuine friend I talked to every day. She was just an amazing person all around. Really kind,patient, thoughtful and considerate. The kind of person you wanted to make happy all the time. As someone who's struggled their whole life with depression and anxiety having someone being as nice as she was to me meant so much. I cared about her a lot and went out of my way to help her and make her happy too. Well two months ago she suddenly quit without telling anyone. Needless to say I was devastated. The first few days I was in denial and hoping it wasn't true. The next few days after that I would suddenly break down and cry while working. Even though its been two months now I still don't know what to feel or how to move on. I feel like I've most my reason for smiling without her and like I've lost my voice since I'll never speak to her again. I feel hurt that she didn't even say goodbye and I feel guilty that I wasn't as supportive of her as i could have been knowing full well how stressful her job was. I can't help but blame myself for her leaving because I wasn't a good enough friend in her eyes for her to care that she'd never see me again. 

I don't know what I should do anymore. I'll be leaving that job soon mainly because I feel alone and unhappy without her there. I don't know how to get over her though. If I choose to forget her and all the memories of her that mean so much to me I'm just going to sink deeper into my depression and close myself off from others out of fear of being abandoned again. And truth be told I don't feel comfortable forgetting her. The moments we shared together are memories I'll treasure always the experiences are what make me want to be a better person for her sake. 

I guess what I really need now is for someone to tell me I'll be okay. No ones ever really cared about me or tried seeing the good in me before I met her. Am I right for feeling hurt or is it selfish to feel this way? At the end of the day I just want her to be happy even if she's away from me but that doesn't make it hurt any less.",AskMen,1573893456,Cheshires_Shadow,11,1,True,2019-11-16

How do I make sense of this mess,"Short background about me, I had a tough upbringing, bullied and beaten at school and abused at home. I became a tough guy in highschool, got married, became a cop, marriage fell apart. I'm kinda world weary and i've kept my heart far from love.

I meant a girl who I regularly had to work with. She was just my type in every way. Cute, reader, melloncholly, very sweet, ect. For months we were friends and we just clicked super well and were great friends.

"Total Socially Inept 21-Year-Old M here: I got a girl's number just as friends, but I have next to no actual social capability, it was more of an extrovert-adopts-introvert sort of thing. How do I keep up conversation with one of the few girls willing to talk to me?","I \[21M\] was just at a college ""party"" (meetup of 20 people in a cramped few rooms, with alcohol). This is the first time I've been to such an event in a long time, and I'm horribly socially inept because of it. There's no question, I just can't talk to groups of people or even some people my age one-on-one.

However, this girl joins a small group conversation I was half-assedly contributing to, and to summarize, everyone else left at some point or another, and she got me talking a bit. There wasn't really any alcohol involved, so both of us were.... somewhat subdued compared to the surrounding partygoers. We ended up talking for almost 4 hours straight, and at the end of it all, she said she really enjoyed it and would like to be friends in the future. We exchanged numbers and... well, I dunno what to do. I've never really held a text conversation before, and chances are we won't see each other much IRL, but at the same time, I want to keep up an unexpected friendship.

For reference, I'm not looking to up this to dating or anything, just looking to hold on to a positive acquaintance.

"What do you value more, attractiveness vs. confidence in a woman?","Would you prefer a prettier girl with low self esteem over an average girl with healthy self esteem, or the other way around? 

I am aware that I am objectively attractive but I, as well as many other objectively attractive females, have spent a good part of my life being bullied by other girls out of disdain for my looks, my dieting and keeping in shape, and my being a ‚Äúwhore‚Äù (i.e. being liked by the boys that my assailants fancied). Naturally, my self esteem isn‚Äôt in tip top shape, and I acknowledge that I doubt myself often and can be insecure. And, naturally, this is a turn-off for men. 

I will probably get shit on for this, but I have spent many years wanting to be average. Average girls were never bullied, were never isolated, were never tormented for no reason at all. I see so many objectively average girls who are thriving in healthy relationships while my most attractive friends second guess their worth because of how cruelly they were treated by mean little girls. 

My question is: is lower self esteem that much of a dealbreaker? Do you guys ever stop to think of why?

Men what would you think if a girl asked if you want to hangout for a few minutes in her car?,"So a couple months ago, I asked a guy who is friends with this male friend that I have if he could help me with my college chemistry class and he said yes. 


One time we were kind of flirting and I jokingly kissed him on the cheek. He smiled and chuckled. Another time we were flirting again and I put my hand on top of his and he held it. We just kind of awkwardly kept looking at each other and chuckling. He seemed nervous and was biting his lip; he acted like he wanted to do or say something but didn't know if he should. I really wanted to kiss him but I didn't know if he wanted to kiss so I decided not to do it. 

I have kissed guys before but they always kissed me first. 

He has told me before that he likes to go hiking on trails and stuff. I remembered that there is the national park with a hiking trail and I asked him if he wants to go with me and he said yes. 


Yesterday we met at the park and walked for like 5 minutes but it was freezing out so we just decided to stay in the car and talk. At first it was causal but it became flirty pretty quick. I told him that I really like hanging out with him; he smiled and kissed me on the lips for the first time. He gave me a couple more small kisses on the lip. It started getting late and we made plans to hangout this weekend. Then he gave me a peck on the lips and a hug. 

I really want to makeout with him but I just don't really know to initiate it.

I love gift giving, but only really when I feel inspired in the sense of knowing it's a book they've wanted to read for a while, or something extra to add to an interest, or something hand crafted. Ie, something that shows I've thought about them and what they'd really like.

I myself am not very ceremonial and tell people if they can't think of something, not to worry (since I apply my attitude to receiving gifts) but I still understand for some people it's really important.

How do you approach gift giving? Do you always feel like the gifts you're giving are well thought out and you like giving them?

I don't know how to make my boyfriend happy (please read post),"Hi! I find talking to my women friends isn't giving me a good response, so I decided to come here and ask anonymous men.
I'm a 25 year old woman. I love my boyfriend more than anything, but (because this is anonymous) he's very clingy. Which is okay. We're also ""millenials"" and live at home apart, but also not far apart; literally a two minute drive apart.

I'm also trying to keep this very PG and clean because I don't know what flies in this Reddit.

We've been in a relationship for over two years, and have expressed numerous times we want to spent the rest of our lives together. We've picked out child names, how our wedding will look; everything.


But he's feeling abandoned. We don't have ""intimate relations"" as much as the average couple; and that's completely on me. I've been extremely depressed for a while, because of education issues. But he also feels upset I don't watch movies and cuddle up, don't kiss or hug him enough, etc. I kiss him as much as I can, and ask him to cuddle me when we fall asleep. I'm also the one to always say ""I love you"" first.

He's also the type of person on his phone 24/7; I never use my phone. So he gets upset I don't text him back right away (most of the time I'm working, or spending time with my family. My family is the most important people in my life. I find it rude to be texting while spending time with other people). 


He's been acting extremely distant for these last few days. I asked him what's going on, and be said nothing. The distant texts continued and I pressured him to tell me what's wrong. He said basically everything I expressed in this Reddit post. I told him I've never been in a long term relationship before and don't know how to ""act"" but also want to feel comfortable in this relationship. He just keeps saying we'll talk in person. Well, naturally my anxiety took over and I assumed he wants to break up or he met someone else, which he assured isn't the case.



I don't know how to make a man happy, I guess. I told him I don't want to act a character or be someone I'm not in relationship. I want to be me, and I want him to be him.. but I truly believe the ""bedroom intimacy"" is the issue and he's bottling up his emotions. Living at home makes the intimacy awkward for me, which I've told him... But this issue is arising. I really, don't know what to do.

I really want to be a ""good girlfriend"". I let him have his guy nights without me whenever he pleases without me there. But he gets upset about that and thinks I don't want to spend time with him and his friends. I, personally, don't have many friends; other than my work friends and my best friend, but never go out, so I'm just at a loss and need a man's input.",AskMen,1571295629,herya889,14,1,True,2019-10-17

Would you ever date a virgin in her late 20s or early 30s?,"Let me start off, by saying, that I'm not one due to religious choices! Just I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and have OCD, which is a result of childhood abuse.

Anyways...

It's been about three years, since I've started getting my life back together and I guess you could say, I sort of went through an 'ugly duckling' phase ü§∑ I used to be fairly overweight, very weird (like I was pretty socially awkward) and generally hid away from the world. Recently I went from weighing nearly 200 pounds (Note I'm 5'8. So I carry my weight well.) to 159; after agressively working out and eating better, which I felt incredibly proud of but that's not my whole point. Since my weight loss, I've discovered, I'm quite attractive, I've dyed my (formerly) brown hair, platinum blonde, have a few tattoos, piercings and discovered I've got a nice body. Which also made me feel super happy üôÇ What can I say? I'm proud of myself again.

Now I'm getting to the real zinger ü§™ I sort of developed a really big ego with a lust for exhibitionism, from all the attention, I'd received from guys... 

I'd send nudes/videos of myself to pretty much every and any guy I spoke too. A few had girlfriends and the others were single. Or well that's what they said, they were üôÑAnd I've fooled around with a few guys too; once with a co-worker in car during my lunch break, two guys at a club; I met on Halloween, one in the back of his car and another co-worker in the back space of my work. Even after all of that, I found out a few of the guys had taken screenshots of the pictures I sent them (without my consent) and a few of them, shared the videos I sent them too (without my consent). And the suck part of it all, I genuinely liked a few of those guys and believed those assholes sweet nothings, they whispered to me too.

I'm not proud of any of that either. Trust me! Another fucked up factor, I was usually the one, who always initiated everything too. As I've said before, I loved the attention and then I'd get way too attached to the guys and did everything, I desperately could to keep them interested. Why? Because as I've stated before, it all stems from childhood trauma, mashed with emotional issues and super low self-esteem. I simply went off the deep end. And my family (in their own loving way) helped me put an end to my 'hoeish' ways. 

I still have a few things, I do still need to change but I've dramatically changed my ways (again somethings can be worked on but as they say Rome wasn't built in a day) and I'm focusing on myself; like I should've done, before a certain jerk pulled my attention towards him. It's nice knowing there's no rush for anything. Everyone does things at their own pace. But I'm not gonna settle for just any guy (like how some of my relatives think I should), I'd rather continue doing my thing, while I better myself as a person in general and when the right guy comes along, I'll try and take things slowly. Because I don't want him thinking I'm easy. And I really gotta ask guys too, if their single as well. I don't wanna become a potential side piece either haha 

So yeah...

"For those of you who went through an identity crisis or lost your sense of self what did you do to get it back? Also how do you just push yourself outside your comfort zone without worrying about what people think? I know this is askMen but, hopefully boys are allowed here.","For starters I'm a 17 year old dude who has been having an identity crisis over the past few months. I know 17 is really early  and uncommon to have this kind of thing. As ridiculous as it sounds this period of constant self doubt, constant anxiety, no one irl to open up to with this is taking a toll on my mentally. What makes it worse is that it came out of absolutely nowhere. I was so sure of myself, my goals, and my everything and now I'm sure of nothing and it's really bringing me down. My motivation is pretty much non existent at this point mostly because of my genuine goals being shit on and the fact that I'm autistic which would make certain things like driving, living independently, making friends, and surviving in the real world damn near impossible. I was also raised and still live as a Jehovah's  Witness which means I never really got to experience much of a normal life or do things any normal teenager would get to do. I dont want to be a JW and never did yet I pretended to be one for so long to please my mother and to get her off my back. I've pretended for so long I pretty much lost my sense of self. Then again my style and tastes were always changing. Along with the severe anxiety from this I also have violent thoughts, catastrophic thoughts, occasional passive death wishes, easily angered even in a good mood, constantly thinking about sex. Just very out of character for me. I seriously dont know what's wrong with me but, to me life feels pointless and directionless for me. Im turning 18 this month and am the least bit excited more so very anxious. I'm also homeschooled and dont have any close friends as well as not being able to drive. Doesnt really matter to me because I dont want to talk to anyone anyway. Has anyone ever gone through this, if so how have you gotten past it. Also how do you stop caring about what people think or more so what family think? As well as not feeling responsible for other people's happiness? I'm tired of not knowing what I want or who I want to be. I'd rather do nothing than have this level of uncertainty and anxiety. I just dont know what I want yet I'm pretty unhappy with life as is.

Dealing with swamp ass?,"Dear men, I would be really interested in discussing how to deal with this condition.

I  am 23 years old and have been hitting the gym since I was 18. I am in good shape but am a bit of a 'thick' guy with a large ass. I don't know why but this condition became  very prevalent around the time I became 20. Since then, I had tried  new underwear and saw big changes. But now, it's as if this condition is becoming prevalent again and I just don't know what to do or who to speak to.

It's so very  embarrassing. Sometimes I sit in AC'ed rooms for 1-2  hours and I stand up with this patch of sweat. On some chairs, I  sometimes leave a visible sweat mark. This happens in various places: restaurants, offices, etc... To be fair, the country I am living in has a rather hot climate; when I go to colder climates, I don't  experience this problem very frequently. If it makes any difference, I like to stay at home with underwear, so probably my body experiences some shock when I put on more clothes? I don't know what to say...

I would be glad to hear about how anyone here handles swamp ass, maybe somebody could relate to my situation too. In particular, I would hope to speak more about whether this condition is related to physical health (did anyone see a difference by becoming skinnier/bulkier?), whether this condition has had an impact on your psychological life (confidence/insecurity/with girls) or maybe was even triggered by being nervous/anxious?",AskMen,1569989949,pukatm,1,1,True,2019-10-01

Is it bad to circumcise your sons?,"I saw a post on r/AmITheAsshole where a guy was asking if he was the asshole because he didn‚Äôt want his son to be circumcised. His wife wanted it. He said that he thought it was unnecessary and if the child wants to have it done when he‚Äôs older, that‚Äôs his own choice but he won‚Äôt do it without the kid‚Äôs permission. And I thought yeah whatever.

Then I looked in the comments and seriously every upvoted comment was talking about how it‚Äôs male genitalia mutilation and it was disgusting. They talked as it was horrible to circumcise your sons. And I was so confused. People saying that if it isn‚Äôt for medical reasons, it‚Äôs a sick thing to do.

I‚Äôm circumcised. My parents weren‚Äôt very religious, my dad was even an atheist. Don‚Äôt ask me why I know this, but most of my buddies are. One of them is getting the procedure done soon, though I think his is for medical reasons or something.

I‚Äôm not upset with my parents for choosing to do it for me. I don‚Äôt really care. Actually, I prefer this way because it just seems so much better personally.

*Personal opinion*: It‚Äôs not often (in my limited experience) that guys  get complimented, and while my friends and I roast each other a lot in our group, I realized I‚Äôve never actually taken the time to send a wholesome comment/compliment towards them in a long time. For me, it‚Äôs definitely a confidence booster, and compliments tend to stick with me for a long time.

"Girl I‚Äôm interested in takes days to reply, but always says yes to hang out. What is the deal?","Long story short I met a girl through my best friends girlfriend. It‚Äôs one of her good friends. We were all at a bar for my friends girlfriends birthday and I met her there, and we immediately clicked, and exchanged numbers. When I texted her in the am she never replied. Two weeks after that she reaches out to me saying hello. I considered this dead on arrival, so I just decided to ask her out to get to know each other more. She said yes after I said time and place and she stopped texting immediately. Didn‚Äôt hear from her for 3 days until we were getting together and we actually still went out. She had an amazing time because her friend called me to tell me, but now we go back to square one.

Both days don‚Äôt really work though..what about Thursday?‚Äù We set plans and same thing, no more replies.

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is I see this girl is active on social media, which isn‚Äôt the problem. I have no issue either if she‚Äôs the in person type, but it‚Äôs such a rarity to see that in this day and age. Do you think this girl may be interested based on the fact that she does say yes to hanging out, or is she most likely playing her options, or something else?

(sorry, idk how else to describe it) daughter and, eventually, daughter-in-law.

On the guys end, they're usually expected to be educated, have a stable job (or have a very clear end-goal of a stable job), answer questions they're asked (I guess?), and appeal to the parents personality-wise (this last one is pretty variable depending on the people).

Now, obviously, in an arranged marriage, I'm not really going in looking for someone who makes me feel a ""spark"" or anything like that on the first meeting/first few meetings. Mostly it depends on if our families seem compatible (in views, beliefs, values, etc), and does this person seem stable/dependable. The cultural view is pretty much: feelings come after.

So, really, my question boils down to, like, in respect to the cultural ideals both parties are trying to portray, what do guys look for/expect when meeting someone for a potential arranged marriage? What's your perception on it, taking into account the cultural/religious expectations? Do guys even like the idea of an arranged marriage?",AskMen,1568687505,the_am,2,3,True,2019-09-16

"My girlfriend (23F) asked if she could speak with her ex, started a master's degree and has completely changed in the space of a week. For men in a similar situation, what is going on and how do I deal with it to not hurt her or myself?","I (27M) met the most beautiful girl of my life at a new office I moved into about a year ago. She looks exactly like Jessica Connelly in Topgun. I saw her, instantly fell head over heels and got her number. We meet a couple of times and hours pass like minutes, she's just as smart and intelligent as she is good looking. We kiss once - but, she tells me she has a boyfriend. I'm disappointed but also not surprised - if it sounds too good to be true it usually is.

She tries to stay in contact and I tell her that we shouldn't talk anymore. I'm sad, but life moves on, the year ends and I start a new job at a new place. Fast forward a few months, she gets back in contact with me. She has split for several months with her former boyfriend and we start chatting again. A couple of months later, we agree to meet in person and it is straight fire.

After an amazing summer together, she goes to finish a masters degree in France and I stay east to work, with an agreement in place to give this long-distance relationship a shot. We text a lot, she sends me super cute video and voice message updates. Although it isn't ideal, we're both busy and working hard and communicating well.

Then, two weeks ago, she sends me a message out-of-the-blue asking if she can meet her ex. I say of course, and its good they keep a friendship.

I then go off trekking in the mountains and am not connected to the internet. When I get back, she sends me a couple of messages explaining to me that she has just received her schedule and her course is an intensive one, from monday - saturday; she'd have to cancel our planned trip (weekend getaway in October). In fact, she said aside from Christmas (which for her and me is with family), she would not be able to see me for six months at all. She said she doesn't want me flying over for just a single night. and that every weekend has courses on a Saturday. I thought that was crazy, but possible, as they are doing a year's work in half the time. She sounds sad about it and expresses that she's worried I'll leave her because of this. But it doesn't quite all add up.

She then took it a step further and started telling me that she thinks it would be best to give me 'freedom' (i.e. a hall pass) in the next six months and we can resume things in March. While i'm not one to judge, I have no interest in sleeping around while staying in a relationship. When I called her to talk about this she sounded jovial, as if it was the best thing she could do for me. I explained to her that it was hurtful and if she is worried that I'll cheat in the next six months, we should talk and not jump to conclusions. I tell her either we are together, or we split and I don't want to hear from her again in six months or the future (this is because it would be the second time my heart is broken - i really do love her). She's upset about this, but I think understands.

I'm not sure what happened, but something changed after she asked me if she could see her ex. I'm lucky if I get one or two video updates from her where they used to be 10 a day, I ask her for her new address as I write her letters normally, but she says she doesn't use the postbox... She continually insists that we can't see each other for six months. It seems to me she is pessimistic (but maybe realistic) about doing long-distance and constantly finding a reason this won't work.

I feel like something happened, and my trust for her is damaged. I don't know if I'm being paranoid but its torturous. I don't know what to do anymore.

Couple of facts about the situation that will perhaps help you overlook my bias:

* She has a fear of abandonment; her mother left her at a very young age.
* She just started her new university program a week ago.
* She doesn't want to commit to weekly phonecalls on a sunday because the timezone difference would be too late for me.

Either this is a weird fidelity test or she is being super pessimistic about us working out, or she wants out (and is maybe seeing someone). How crazy am I? Anyone have experience with this type of situation? Anything I can do to clear things up?",AskMen,1568695408,cjps1234,14,4,True,2019-09-16

How to show that you want more than friendship?,"Hello i am m,23 and i am doing an erasmus semester in another part of europe. So i am really happy here and i also met some people that i often hang out with. There is a girl in this group i really like but yeah i am a pretty shy person and i don't know what to do. I think she also likes me but we only see each other when the group is doing something except one time we did something together because nobody else came and we had a pretty good time. So my question is how to initiate more than that. I was thinking about that i just ask her if she wants to do something just the two of us but i am afraid that this question is too early and it might be awkward. But i am also afraid that if i wait to long she just sees me as a friend.",AskMen,1568707638,semmel1,9,6,True,2019-09-17

"Best friend replaced me with his gf, what now?","So I've been friends with a dude for the last 2-3 years over Xbox. We actually met in highschool in like the 9th grade and he moved towards the end of 10th grade. Back then we were just friends of friends and both of us were shy and quiet so we never got to personally meet. 

The friend group stayed together and played Xbox for a year or 2 until it kinda split into 2 groups. During that time I basically still stayed friends with both groups, and our friendships kinda for stornger because there were less people to worry about at a given time.

Anyways, I became super close to this dude and it was great for almost 3 years. We eventually figured out that we were actually super similar personality wise and so we shared a bunch of like personal shit together that no other friends really got in on. We definitely aren't gay or anything like that shit, but basically had a perfect bromance going on.

We usually played games together, but over the past few months both of us have been getting kinda depressed and bored of games so we'd just talk. We still had some really good times, but  talking can only get you so far...

Here's where it all just kinda crumbles. 
One day some new girl started working with him and he talked about how he liked her and shit. I supported and encouraged him to go over and talk to her and figure something out, but being shy and awkward he kinda got over her within a week, basically saying something like ""meh she isn't even that great."" Basically implying that she's the ""beat"" looking employee, but that's comparing it to all the like 60 year old ladies that worked there. 

Well one day she decided to hang out with him and that's what started this whole shit storm. It's like within a week he forgot I exist, and the few times we have gotten online together he was either just texting her without paying any attention to what I was saying, or he would just get out of his chair and run to the door because the clingy bitch was at his door...

The few times I broiggt it up that he's being an asshole, he says ""sorry"" and that's the end of the conversation. He even went as far as saying it's my fault that we don't hangout anymore because I don't invite him to do anything. But Everytime I invite, he's either preoccupied or just ignores...

The worst part is that I know his gf is the man in this relationship. He's a shy little bitch just like I am. She bought him a gift before he even knew what was happening, shes the one that takes him out on dates, and he even gives her full control of his phone. I check on his account every once in a while and hes always following some gay heart throb bands or weird poetry accounts. 

It hurts me even more because im convinced that she read all our texts so she basically knows all my secrets and shit. I don't care that she knows everything, im just upset that my best friend betrayed me like that. 

To add on to this this, he knows that im going through some depression, because he was going through the same shit. So he left me as my best friend, blames our falling apart for me not trying hard enough, exposed all our convos because he has no filter with her, and left me to deal with my depression by myself...


Is this like a common thing? 

Also I'd like to add that if they ever break up and if he does come crawling back to me all bitchy and depressed, I'll be there for him because im not a total monster, but as soon as he gets over her im gonna politely end the friendship. I don't wanna be that person that's there as basically a girlfriend replacement for him. I'll be his ""friend"" during the heartbreak, but I won't stick around anymore than I need to.",AskMen,1568709671,AnxiousAnal,5,1,True,2019-09-17

How do you view life and how does it feel for you?,"Ever since I became a Bible believer 3 years ago, my life has changed DRASTICALLY. And it seems to change exponentially. 

Number one: I feel like I have a better understanding of the world.

Two: I feel safer, like God is behind everything, and even when I die, He has a plan and he's designed it in a way to be as gentle as possible even though it seems scary.

Three: I just feel more gratitude and joy. Joy that I am alive and that I get to experience things and have so many blessings. Before I became a believer, I saw life as a curse, even possibly a matrix prison, with nothing to be thankful for. But I see that there are a lot of things to be enjoyed and that God must had to have created them simply for us to enjoy.

Now I'm starting to shift into feeling the temporality of this life, I can love people more and be more patient and forgiving because I can the shortness of time more and mentality I'm already at the finish line. Like I can see myself dead soon and that way have fun in this moment because now I'm seeing life as a game where I don't have to take it seriously and worry. I can chose how to direct it into a more loving way.

But most of the time I can't make it past the first date. The furthest I ever went was three dates, but it had to end there because I had to leave town. I realized that sometimes it's my fault - I come on too strong, I ask stupid questions... but I've been working on that and I'd dare say I'm much better at dating than I was a year ago.

Yet, I can't seem to get second dates with the people I really want to see again. Recently I went out with a girl I could really get along with. Everything seemed to go fine on the date - we could talk easily, she flirted with me, I flirted with her... she even said she had a lot more fun than she thought she would have. But when I asked for a second date, she was hesitant and eventually said she didn't see much in common with me. Strange.

We get along pretty well and hang out with a small group of others. She's asked me before if I had any feelings for her which I denied.

Fast forward to now and I've moved to a different state temporarily, my friend is visiting her family and said she's going to stop by and visit me as well. Keep in mind that she has to drive 3 hours to get to my city and we're going to see each other later next year. She asked if she could stay over at my place which I agreed.  I've thought about this whole visit as friendly regathering until my roommate asked me if I would go out of my way and drive 3 hours to see a friend.

How do we handle spousal abuse?,"I thought about using a throwaway to post this, but I‚Äôve decided not to as this is a serious topic and I thinking being real is the only way to proceed.

It‚Äôs 1:30 am here in NYC, today I went out for a friends brother-in-laws bachelor party.  The plan was to grab some cigars and enjoy them at a nice cigar bar, hit up an amazing spot to eat, and then jump around to some rooftop bars.  There is a sizable group of us here, 12 to be exact.

While enjoying cigars at the first spot, several of the guys start joking around how it‚Äôs nice to get out, etc, etc... this part of the conversation continues around the table until one person mentions that him and his wife got into a fight about this and straight up mentions that she hit him... not one, or twice, but repeatedly.  I at first was in shock... but then I looked around... and no one else was.

Of the group, I am the only one not married (I‚Äôm 34), but have been in a long relationship where my gf and I have lived together for over 3 years.

What I thought was going to turn into a discussion of ‚Äúdude, that is abuse and is not right‚Äù instead turned into 11 men talking about how their wive hit them...

One was how he was driving and she started kicking him and punching while driving...

Another how she threw a shoe at him the he dodge and it stuck in the wall...

The stories were constant and every guy except me had something to add

The only common denominator I saw was they all kinda realize it‚Äôs not right but...‚Äùwe have a kid, and I can‚Äôt let my kid deal with that‚Äù...

Many stories were of them saying ‚ÄúI grabbed her arm once to stop her and she threatened to call the police on me for attacking her‚Äù...

I was shocked! Dumbfounded... I couldn‚Äôt even imagine laying a hand on my gf, let alone her laying a hand on me (and we have had our share of fights)

Men of Reddit... I thought this was a few and far between problem.  I am clearly wrong.  If this is happening to you, please, say something... if not to us, to family or anyone and seek help.

How many kindergartners do you think you could personally take on in a fight before being overpowered?,"Stipulations and context:

1. The kindergartners are released 5 at a time every 30 seconds.
2. The arena is a standard sized classroom, let's say 40 feet wide by 25 feet deep. However, the room is completely empty.
3. The kindergartners are unarmed. They are just going to run at you, attempting to punch, kick, bite, and scratch you. Their ultimate goal is to cumulatively dog pile on you and pin you to the ground. If they can pin you for 15 consecutive seconds, you lose.
4. You have to knock a kindergartner unconscious in order to defeat them. Once they are knocked unconscious, they vanish from the classroom arena.
5. You can use any strategy you want to fend them off, but you are also unarmed and you are not allowed to leave the room.",AskMen,1566110907,MyMediocreName,2530,22391,True,2019-08-17

I hit a double and slid to second and tore up my leg pretty good on the way. 

So here's the thing - I have super thick leg hair, and with all the goop the wound is making, my leg hair is getting matted down into it, and I'm afraid this will delay the healing process. Do any of you have experience with something like this? Should I shave the affected area or will that do more harm than good? Thanks in advance.

"Alright guys, what do I do?","**Look, I know this post will be met with plenty of responses telling me to get past this girl but I can't, I'm simply too deeply in love with her.**

I have been seeing my girlfriend Sara for the past two years and she is wonderful. We do everything together like going to the movies, going for a walk in the park, getting coffee and I never, ***NEVER*** in a million years thought that I'd be met with a challenge this great with Sara, though the day has come. She's been seeing another man behind my back.

I didn't know the man, and he so casually just hit on her in front of me without taking my feelings, or her feelings into consideration, however given what has just happened recently I don't know if she had feelings to begin with.

She just so casually went with him, like I was a ghost to be swept up in the wind. I approach this hot-shot and go, ""Hey there faggot! I'm Sara's boyfriend Jeff, so what's your gay name?"" before anyone could fully process what was happening, he swung at me. He missed underestimating the fact that I've been in this exact same situation *several* times before, and before he could throw a second hit I quickly laid him on his ass.

Sara was of course terrified as despite us going out for years she has never seen that side of me. I calmly yet sternly ask, ""What. the. fuck. is going on Sara?"" before having my ears pierced with a blood curdling, ""HELP ME!"". Police arrived on the scene soon-there-after and I spent the night in the big pen and was charged with assault and battery.

I'd no idea what to do, and in a moment of vulnerability and despair I called Sara. I started the conversation off with, ""Look babe, I don't know how we're going to cope with this, but we'll get past it I promise. However based on the severity of the situation, I'll have to strike at an unknown time"". A few seconds of silence went by before she responded with, ""You better stay the fuck away from me and my boyfriend or else I will make your life a fucking nightmare!"" to which I simply just told her that I loved her.

I don't know what to do right now and given that she will be my wife next month stress has just been piling up on me like Nagasaki.

**TL;DR** I caught my girlfriend with another man and was charged with assault and battery. I've since notified my girlfriend of her punishments and she, of course, is stressed.

How to deal with feeling like a failure?,"Life's been bashing me in the face with a bat my whole life. So my current situation isnt anything out of the blue. But I work and work and work on progressing shit, get 3 rungs up the ladder, then ALWAYS some shit happens and I end up back on the ground.

I work 90 hours a week. At this point I'm just so exhausted and depressed, I just can't do it anymore. I get like 4 hours of sleep a night. One of my jobs gave me 5 day notice that I'm not gonna be needed anymore.

I work my ass off trying to improve my life and shit just falls apart. I can't do shit right it seems. No matter what I do, it's never enough.

I'm feeling like I'm just gonna always be a failure, life's never gonna get easier, and I'm doomed to my situation forever.

I've been considering just getting a gun and eating a bullet cause I'm tired of all this shit. But somehow I got a GF (friends for awhile, asked me out), even though she knows my situation. Like, why the fuck would you want to date me? So I can't eat a bullet now. But debating just breaking up with her then eating a bullet cause I can't do shit for her. I can't get myself out of this hole, and her involving with me is only gonna drag her with me. Too sweet a girl to be dragged with me.

My ex always had a low drive for sex, his performance was good and we enjoyed sex but it was almost always me who had to initiate or else we could go on months, yes months, without sex. 


I'm very open to new ideas, positions, toys, etc. But he always made me feel uncomfortable bringing new ideas so I guess instead of being a motivation, it was a turn off for him. The last 4 years we had sex every couple of months and eventually I didn't even bother to look for him.

"Alright guys, what do I do?","**Look, I know this post will be met with plenty of responses telling me to get past this girl but I can't, I'm simply too deeply in love with her.**

I have been seeing my girlfriend Sara for the past two years and she is wonderful. We do everything together like going to the movies, going for a walk in the park, getting coffee and I never, ***NEVER*** in a million years thought that I'd be met with a challenge this great with Sara, though the day has come. She's been seeing another man behind my back.

I didn't know the man, and he so casually just hit on her in front of me without taking my feelings, or her feelings into consideration, however given what has just happened recently I don't know if she had feelings to begin with.

She just so casually went with him, like I was a ghost to be swept up in the wind. I approach this hot-shot and go, ""Hey there faggot! I'm Sara's boyfriend Jeff, so what's your gay name?"" before anyone could fully process what was happening, he swung at me. He missed underestimating the fact that I've been in this exact same situation *several* times before, and before he could throw a second hit I quickly laid him on his ass.

Sara was of course terrified as despite us going out for years she has never seen that side of me. I calmly yet sternly ask, ""What. the. fuck. is going on Sara?"" before having my ears pierced with a blood curdling, ""HELP ME!"". Police arrived on the scene soon-there-after and I spent the night in the big pen and was charged with assault and battery.

I'd no idea what to do, and in a moment of vulnerability and despair I called Sara. I started the conversation off with, ""Look babe, I don't know how we're going to cope with this, but we'll get past it I promise. However based on the severity of the situation, I'll have to strike at an unknown time"". A few seconds of silence went by before she responded with, ""I don't know who you are or what the fuck you're talking about, but you better stay the fuck away from me and my boyfriend or else I will make your life a fucking nightmare!"" to which I simply just told her that I loved her.

I don't know what to do right now and given that she will be my wife next month stress has just been piling up on me like Nagasaki.

**TL;DR** I caught my girlfriend with another man and was charged with assault and battery. I've since notified my girlfriend of her punishments and she, of course, is stressed. I'm currently a stress volcano given that we **will** be married next month.",AskMen,1564827997,Bignuteroonies,9,0,True,2019-08-03

Shoulder rotatory cuff injury ‚Äî how do I proceed?,"Hi guys, I haven't found anything on Reddit that specifically relates to my issue, and in all honesty, it's screwing me up. Background  ‚Äî 5ft10.5, 70KG, M, 22, Non-active. **Please HELP!**

So I used to go to the gym every day, I stopped a year ago because during one shoulder raise, lifting 27kg dumbells (I was pushing it with these), my shoulder gave way. It was like I couldn't push as far as my shoulder muscles or arm muscles wanted to. I came back two days later, to try biceps, and the same thing happened. Then the shoulder pain began, and I knew something was up. So I packed it in, didn't return for a month, and attended a physiotherapist (three sessions only as I couldn't afford more), she pushed into my shoulder, did some things, it felt \*okay\*. Stopped going to the gym completely by this point, had shoulder pain, but not significantly, just when I pushed on them the pain would emerge. Attended an osteopath, they were shit. Went to my GP, they told me to go and get an MRI, did that. Nothing came up, all clear in the eyes of the doctor. Great, but my shoulders still hurt. Now I'm attending a free physiotherapist, who in my first session just looked at my shoulders and did some 'test' exercises, and said, get back into the gym, don't push it, go easy. Sounds good. 

Except, I've been going back. I go and do some shoulder stretches, using weighted cables to do basic rotatory cuff movements. I've been doing [these](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/548172585892843785/?lp=true) and just hanging on a bar. Then yesterday I tried to do some chest work. A year ago today I would've been doing 30s, now 6KGs was relatively hard. So not only are my rotatory cuffs now incredibly weak, but they don't feel 100 per cent.

My physio says its impingement btw. Here's what I think has happened. I never really did rotatory cuff exercises, and I was going up in weights quickly. I don't think my cuffs could keep up. Also, this isn't my first stint in the gym, when I went 4 or so years ago, I also had a bit of 'discomfort' in my shoulders. To this day they click when I move them. Just raising my arm makes my shoulder click, when I do weights, they click, when I stretch my arm, they kind of hurt. I'm also hypermobile.

My question is this, is the pain in the shoulders normal? When I'm doing a rotator cuff exercise, with a 1KG weight, On the 15th rep it's uncomfortable/challenging. Today I've woken up and there's pain on the front sides of both my shoulders, which is where the pains been throughout. 

It's now **over a year and a bit** and I'm f\*\*king fed up of this shoulder bulls\*\*t, like beyond belief. My physio didn't do any sort of pressure work, she just analysed me from afar. My shoulders still bloody hurt (when I just apply pressure on them), and it's plain making me depressed. I know you can go to the gym and do other exercises, but for god's sake, I go to the gym to release stress, and f\*\*king mutilate &amp; exhaust myself with weights. **To anyone reading this, please, for the love of God, look after your shoulders.**",AskMen,1564828582,cronarn,4,0,True,2019-08-03

What Advice Do You Have for Female Friendships? (Situation below)," 

Personal

Sorry for the short story, but:

Hey guys! For the past few days one of my female friends has been acting differently whenever I text her. Most of the time she'll send me stuff and we'll chat for quite some time an it's not difficult whatsoever to carry conversation. I thoroughly enjoy talking to her. But, even via text, I'm getting a different sort of vibe? She never texts me first and whenever I'll send her something that I'm sure she'll like, the only reply I really get is 'Lol'. I've tried asking questions to keep the conversation going but it's completely ignored. The most I can get are 1 or 2 texts at once. Again, we used to carry long strings of convo, but it seems that all that energy is gone. I really enjoy talking to her and it's beginning to make me anxious.

I may be overreacting and she's just been really busy or something for the past few days. What do you think is happening/what I should do? Should I just wait and hope this vibe passes. I'm now questioning myself whenever I think of texting her or video calling, as I feel as if it may annoy her and further contribute to the mood I'm receiving. Anyways, thanks for reading.

How soon is too soon before you ask a lady for a relationship?,"I met a guy this week, we've been taking for 5 days now and he made it clear from day one that he likes me and started hinting at wanting  a relationship.

I like him too, we run in the same social circles so he's not a total stranger and I think he would make a great partner for anyone but I really don't like feeling pressured to decide if we should be together.  I'm not sure that's what I want yet with him. I would love if we just talked some more as friends. I'm 23 and he's in his 30s so i dont know if its became he is older.

My boyfriend and I have great communication when it comes to our past sexual relationships and desires we‚Äôd like to try with each other, however, from my understanding this person he was seeing was a woman he‚Äôd met online that he‚Äôd see on the side (he was in a relationship with another woman at the time).

We are deeply committed and feel like we‚Äôve truly found our soulmate in one another. 

Obviously, I‚Äôm completely in the wrong for snooping - but, from the communication level we have and non judgement on past and future sexual experiences we have makes me surprised he hasn‚Äôt told the truth and say he was actually seeing a man.

Why did my ex follow me?,"Before going into things I just wanted to state that I am a woman (19) also just asking others for their opinion on the situation as I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience, especially from a male POV..! 

Basically, I woke up a few days ago to my ex(17,M) adding me on Instagram. We broke up almost a year ago and we had a really difficult break up. Granted he‚Äôs two years younger than me and when I went to college of course we were going to break up. There was no closure and I was very unhappy with the way things ended. However as time went on I realized I needed to work on myself and focus on myself and since then I have been such a better person. I blocked him when we broke up and recently I felt that I had enough closure to unblock him. I didn't feel extremely hurt anymore so I found it was unnecessary and petty from my perspective to keep him blocked. Looking back this was an adolescent relationship. After all, we grew up together and had many of the same mutual friends.

Turns out he also recently broke up with his new girlfriend (who I think was a rebound, as it was so sudden and she was a freshman in high school...). I‚Äôm not even really interested in trying to get back together with him I know there‚Äôs always that possibility, but I‚Äôm really just focused on me and it‚Äôs so unrealistic to me as I‚Äôm in college and he is a senior in high school. I just have no idea what he wants from following me!!! We haven‚Äôt even talked since we broke up, at all, nothing!! I‚Äôve had enough closure and really really worked on investing in me and my future. I‚Äôm not petty about the situation anymore so if he really wants to lurk on me he can see me living my best life... I‚Äôm just an inexperienced young woman and would like some other insight to this strange add on social media, what‚Äôs it even mean!?? Should I expect a DM or something from him? I'm just confused...!

And what if I'm the rebound... I can't be... I was the original...?

Basically, this is really just eating at me. I'm obsessively thinking about him, not even with any intentions of getting back together. I just can't get him out of my head, I don't really miss him I. just. can't. stop. thinking. about. him. I don't know if there is some underlying ulterior motive for the follow. He was also the only serious boyfriend I ever had, we were best friends too. I don't know why I am obsessing over this so much.

"Men, how do you escape the box you've put yourself in?","Okay. to make this short and simple, I'm viewed as a nerd. I like gaming, anime, etc. Basically all the nerdy things. There's nothing wrong with that of course, but it creates a massive problem for me because once someone knows I'm into those things, I'm forever in that nerdy box....

MOST people view nerds a very specific way, and that makes it hard to connect with people who aren't nerdy. I'm 21 and I believe I'm ready to stop being so nerdy. This has little to do with others' opinions and more to do with the fact that I'm growing out of it, I believe. 

I only really keep up with one anime consistently, and I don't buy nearly as many games as I used to, but the biggest problem is, is that a lot of my personality has unfortunately been crafted around these 2 things. I have a hard time building a friendship with others if they aren't into these things, and one of my pre requisites when dating is that they have to like nerdy things... This is a completely horrible mindset, but I don't know how to get rid of it.

I don't want to get rid of my love for these things, I just want to not make them a priority. I want to find other things to be passionate about. ( I draw, workout, do casual photography, learning martial arts and I want to learn how to dance) where do I start? I don't want my love for gaming to be the only thing I'm known for. I want to have a diverse set of interests and a vivid personality, but I strongly believe gaming and anime are a crutch.

The reason why it's a crutch is because there's such a wide range of games and anime that there's always something to talk about. As weird as this sounds, I honestly don't know how people go hours jumping from topic to topic because most of my life I've only talked about those 2 things with friends and that's it. How do I diversify my conversations?!

Why does this guy keep hitting me up and then ignoring my replies?,"So I ended up hooking up with an old coworker from a previous job. He initially messaged me on Instagram out of nowhere, chatting me up and eventually asked if we could hang out at his place. I already knew what to expect because I haven't been looking for anything serious. I eventually realized he found my old tinder profile, hence him being in my dm's. 

So anyways, the day after that night, he messages me about how amazing the sex was, telling me that he wants to do it again soon. I figured this was only gonna be a one time thing, but I was up for it and agreed on meeting up again. We decide to meet last Friday, but he confesses that he's too drunk and its best we not meet that night. I really didn't mind to be honest, but now he's starting to be weird as hell. 

He's messaging me, asking every night if we can meet up, but when I answer he leaves me on seen. He's done this to me three times consecutively, so I'm planning to meet with another guy on Friday because he's being too weird at this point. 

Why does he keep doing this to me? I'm just trying to have a good time, no strings attached, but he's acting really weird. Is it something I did and does it have anything to do with me?",AskMen,1562213258,artcoco,1,1,True,2019-07-03

Chances of relationship ending?,Hi I am a 18 year old who just graduated high school this year is is regretting my past and it is causing me major depression. Last summer me and my friends started hanging out with these group of girls and one of the girls liked me. I decided not to date her because I was to focused on my business and saw that every month she was dating a new guy and I didn‚Äôt want to be just another guy. Time went on and the school year began and she found the guy she was going to date all school year. I regretted my decision right after she started dating this guy and it ate away at me all year. The boyfriend is a sophomore and she is a senior. Anyways we both just graduated and are going to the same community college this year. The boyfriend will stay in high school as a junior. I would say I am a good friend of hers and if she broke up with him she would be interested in me again. During their relationship this year they broke up a total of 4 times but got back together almost the next day. I have heard some negative things about their relationship however they are still together which is confusing. I am just wondering what are the chances they break up ever? I am going to give some random details because I don‚Äôt know how to put them in order. I go to the gym with her 3 times a week. They are constantly texting each other about something. I run a business that makes 60k a year in passive income and have a significant amount saved up. I have went from a tall skinny lanky kid when she first liked me to a tall stronger looking man thanks to working out and growing a beard. Which she complements me on every time I see her. Anyways if you had to put a percentage on them staying together what would it be? Also any tips or advice you have please comment. Thanks,AskMen,1562221650,reddituser1011123425,1,1,True,2019-07-03

Would you say the phrase ‚Äúyou can do it your young and a man!‚Äù Is ABSOLUTE bs. Why or why not?,"Summary at the end.

So I was in desperate need of a job during the summer and I mad applied to a bunch of jobs. All I landed were 2 warehouse jobs god fired from one and I got another. But it‚Äôs extremely understaffed so they have me doing almost slave work. I had to unload 2 trucks with one other guy for 5 hours and each box was 20-40 pounds but these trucks had around 500+ boxes. So they told me I HAD to unload them before I ended my shift. I started working so hard my leg started to give out and i started to limp and my spine hurts. But they tell me to do it because I‚Äôm young. They also want me to help girls that take almost double my lunch breaks because the boxes are heavy when I‚Äôm done with my work. This sounds absolutely outrageous but I really need a job. And I don‚Äôt understand why people think this is okay. Anyways I feel that people prey upon the young especially men because they feel we are ‚Äúcapable‚Äù. When according to today‚Äôs standards anyone can do anything. All I have to say is I‚Äôm tired of people yelling equality when inequality exists everywhere. So on people will never see each other as equals (hence why I do harder work then the girls and they know it). So on sometimes because of circumstances some aren‚Äôt equal. The girl that I help probably couldn‚Äôt do what I do for her and what I do myself when working... she said it herself. This is in no way me trying to get self gratification I‚Äôm just stating some answers I have from the questions that arise during my day to day activities.

Summary:

I work at a warehouse where it is extremely under staffed. I am quite young and a male and everyone else is either old or a girl or does office work which they teach on the job. I am just as capable and competent as doing the other work everyone else does yet the give me the work that physically hurts me. They tell me to do it because I‚Äôm ‚Äústronger and younger‚Äù. So on they have me help girl workers because they are ‚Äúweaker‚Äù. I am as humanly as anyone else girl, old, or desk job so it‚Äôs wrong to say I can handle physically damaging because I am stronger and a man.",AskMen,1560922315,Geojere,6,3,True,2019-06-18

Can I ask SO to leave phone out of bathroom when showering?,"TLDR: can I tell my husband he needs to leave his phone out of the bathroom when he showers so I can trust him again?

Background: my husband (33M) and myself (30F) grew up Mormon. Porn is considered the new drug. It's bad, bad, bad. I've had that ingrained in my mind since I knew what it was. I'm out of the church, he is too. We've been married 10 years.

 He once told me he masturbated to memories of pictures of me, but a year ago I found what he looked at on Instagram. Bikini models, softcore porn. I've tried to be okay with it. I'm even more okay with actual video porn with MF, etc. instead of pictures of other women. But I'm not. I'm just not. And he lied... we have two kids.  The only time I see myself okay with it is if I'm not in the same place at the time, like a business trip, etc. And even then, I don't want him looking at other women. Sexual acts of people together, I'm trying to be okay with. 

I don't want to control his life. But my needs are not met in our marriage and I can't trust him. I don't know how to have faith in him again. It hurts me. He knows it does and he deliberately does it when he showers, when I'm more than willing and eager to that night. I don't want to own his sexuality, but I can't see me getting to a place where I will ever be okay with him watching it without me.

I can't imagine leaving him, taking my kids from him. I love him so much. I want him in my life. Not to mention the logistics of separating a household... 

Basically, I want to know if I can ask that he leaves his phone out of the bathroom when he showers or keeps the door unlocked. If I'm not home, fine. If he refuses, can I let that be the end of our marriage?",AskMen,1560923083,altruistic_cynic,67,0,True,2019-06-18

I'm in my mind 30s,  I work as a coordinator for a midsize company, I love my job, I'm good at it and I never thought I had to be ashamed of it. I have also always¬† manage to save money and travel despite that my income has always been below 50k. 

He mentioned to me that he always dreamed of marrying a successful business/ career oriented¬† woman but that on the other hand he can see that I would be perfect for him because I would be an excellent mother and wife. However the longer we date the more I notice that it bothers him that I don't have a degree and it makes me feel really bad about myself because it's not like I didn't want to go to school or that I'm not a smart capable woman.

Nevertheless I gotta admit that this is making me feel very insecure about my selfworth. I know in the coming days I will end the relationship with him because I don't want to be with someone who cannot understand or like me for who I am; But I also wonder how often I will have to deal with the same issue when I go back to dating.

"How to tell if you're emotionally numb, or if it's just who you are.","I would think the title says it all. But some context.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've had this recurring thought that *maybe* I just have a monotone personality, and have a severe lack of emotions. I obviously can feel happy, sad, or annoyed, etc. But they're not extreme at all. I don't get overly upset when other people would, say, family member dying, or someone screwing you over. I don't get overly excited at news in my life as if I was blessed by some mean or another, whether that be general relationships, or good fortune. It all feels *monogamous.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I was a normal child either. Most children (I'm talking 4 or 6 year old) think only through emotion. For example, when I was young, six maybe, I was at the park, and it was getting dark. Mum, wanting to leave, and after repeatedly enforcing the idea of leaving, she finally resulted to ""Alright, I'm leaving, get in the car, or I'll leave without you"". I would imagine most kids, even stubborn ones would think emotionally with ""oh no, mummy's going to leave without me! :("". But I still hesitated, because I knew she wouldn't, and I continued to refuse, until the mosquitoes started to eat me a few minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

I digress, I have suffered depression previously, and I'd consider it situational depression due to *cough cough 'circumstances' at home.* and know how it felt to feel nothing. But this, as I ask the question, feels slightly different. That sort of depression felt like nothing - emotions were almost blocked entirely. This feels bland, watered down, where emotions exist, but are nearly impartial to one another.   


I'm curious to find out if this is just who I am? If it's a problem to be concerned about, or just a personality type. As vague as childhood seems now, the few that remain still felt like I felt a lot, and lived bigger in a way.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how do you tell whether or not you just have a bland set of emotions, or if that's just a personality type. Or whether it's an underlying problem that needs some sort of therapy. Has anyone else experienced this sort of existential crisis before? Is it normal? How did you find out, and what did you do?

&amp;#x200B;

(Apologies if this isn't in the guideline of the rules, I don't often open up. In fact the few therapy sessions I had, both professionals thought I was fine, mentally, physically? etc. I don't know if this is specific, I think it's pretty open, but who knows.)",AskMen,1560937389,Dr__Waddle,97,181,True,2019-06-19

"Men who have been abandoned by their fathers as teenagers, what's your story?","I frequently have bad dreams due to the issues I have with my father just essentially ghosting me. My father remarried when I was 7, 3 years after he and my mother divorced. I still saw him (and my new step-mom and step-sister) fairly regularly as a young kid up until I was 14. Then he stopped calling on his own and stopped trying to set up visits and I just kind of moved on with my life in high school due to the the hour long drive between and just being busy with schoolwork. I'd occasionally receive a Christmas or Birthday card with $20 and nothing written in it, that I would call to thank him for. The last time I saw him I was 18 and had just gotten into a big argument with my depressive mother after we had lost the house I essentially grew up in. She left me in the house we were being kicked out from and drove 50 miles to the new rental. I ended up getting a ride to my fathers house from my friends and stayed one night with him. I hadn't been there all of high school and saw that my room had completely vanished and been turned into this anonymous guest room. The next morning we talked a bit and he gave me $300 to get my car registered so I could find work and then told me that this was the last thing he would ever do for me and sent me back to my mom. I couldn't really process it at the time I wanted to believe that my father still loved me, it didn't make sense that he couldn't for some reason. I never did drugs in high school, I never drank, I was an advanced placement student but for some reason my father couldn't find pride in me the way he did my step sister. How was I supposed to live up to my valedictorian step sister who ended up going to an amazing university on a big scholarship? 
I'm 26 now and have learned my lesson that there's nothing I could have done to make him love me but still since then I've hesitantly tried to reach out to him twice now, just over facebook since we live on different sides of the state now. but so far all I've gotten is rejection and his profile going to private for the next several months after. Family and friends who have heard what I've gone through try to comfort me and tell me he's an asshole and that he's the one missing out and that I'm better off but I'm still left wondering occasionally by intrusive thoughts what I did that actually drove him away. What did I do that made him decide to stop calling, that made him decide to not attend my high school graduation, and to not even be in my life enough just to know that I graduated from college. I'm also left angry and jealous of my step sister who's received all of his love even though she was already in high school before they even met. The sister who's wedding I wasn't even invited to, who's gotten the rest of her tuition paid for by him and has had family vacations across the world with him while I struggle with student loans and rent.

Sometimes we end up in silence because I get tired of trying to initiate conversation. My friends think he might just be nervous. Sometimes he can be relatively talkative with others.

I can't tell if I like him back enough without being able to talk to him (which obviously acts as a barrier). 

Does anyone have any advice? Something like conversation topics that I can introduce naturally or ways to let him know he shouldn't be nervous around me?

Should I seduce my [50M] regular at my coffee shop?,"I am a university student in my early 20s. I work out 5x/ week and I am in great shape. I've been told I'm very good looking and All my life I have been hit on by these immature fuckboys and have constantly been told I am mature for my age, and quite honestly it's because I have always been motivated to be the best version of myself mentally emotionally physically and spiritually. Because of this, mental health, wellness, and financial stability has been my focus for quite a while and I don't go out on the weekends to party and get piss drunk. I find it incredibly difficult to relate to people my age and the things women my age are impressed by I honestly find, pathetic and disappointing but anyway, I work at a coffee shop in a rec centre in a suburb were a lot of rich people live. I have changed the names to keep this  confidential. ""Sam"" has been a regular at my coffee shop for about 2 years. We have built an awesome relationship during this time and he has told me a lot about his personal life and I always ask him for advice. Sam is very fit because he attends fitness classes and he cares about his health, so he does looks maybe 40?  Being a barista I have become quite good at flirting. I love Sam and I's banter and our conversations are something that I look forward to every week. A couple months ago, Sam saw me on the the bus after my night class downtown because we both live in this suburb. The bus system is great where I live, it goes straight from downtown to the transit station in my suburb and it's no regular bus, it has couch-like seats with wifi and quite honestly its better than driving for 40 mins into the city. Anyway, when he saw me on the bus, he didn't say hi or approach me in any way and I pretended not to see him and listened to music simply because I was unsure whether or not our relationship was only exclusive to the coffee shop. The following weekend he told me that he saw me and he didn't want to be weird etc. (basically feeling the same way) and I told him I was mad he didn't say hi, because honestly I really like him! and this made him very happy. Anyway one time I was asking for recommendations for bars downtown because I wanted to go for drinks after my nightclass the following week and he mentioned that there is a great place he frequents with some coworkers and that I should come! I felt weird about it because I didn't want to stick out and seem like the kid in the group. But a couple weeks later I regretted not going. Sam is divorced and has two kids that are a bit younger than me. Sam and I flirt every time he comes in and honestly it's something I can't help, theres chemistry although he is a lot older. Anyway, this past weekend I decided to bring up that place again and asked him if he was going this week and he said oh no, last weekend i went blah blah blah, and I mentioned that I was going to a networking event nearby and so I would check out the place he talked about previously on that certain day and then I said ""oh so you're not gonna be there?"" and then he changed his story and said, "" oh yeah, i'll be there."" and I was like ok i'll see you there! You should have seen the excitement on his face.. He lingered around the condiment area for a while while I made drinks and was just on his phone and quite honestly I thought he was going to ask me for my number to keep in contact and figure out the exact time but it was crowded and quite honestly people would have judged. Sam is also an engineer and works in one of the most prestigious buildings in the entire city, I know he has stacks. He's even asked me before why I don't quit the coffee shop gig and go for something more ambitious and quite honestly I think he'd even help me land a 9-5 if i really wanted him to. I've been trying to on my own, I have applied to 27 jobs, gotten 9 interviews and never made the cut because I don't have my full degree yet in business. Anyway, is it so bad if I flirt with Sam when I see him this week at the happy hour before the networking event? There are times when we will be the only two people at the coffee shop and he'll say some flirty shit and I will get wet right then and there. I think about what it would be like to seduce him and have a fling with him. Rent hotel rooms in the city and wear some fine ass lingerie and give this guy the time of his life. I want this guy so bad. But do you think if I made a move he would freak out because I am significantly younger than him? Almost 30 years.. I've honestly thought about what it would be like to casually date him.. Go into the city a few times per week and just go for lunch/ dinner. I know I'm in no position to be a step mom or anything BUT getting wined and dined in some of the nicest restaurants in the city and having sex with a guy who turns me on so much doesn't seem so bad to me..  I need responses quick because the day is coming closer and closer. How do I go about this? Am I bad for wanting to seduce this man? I seriously masturbate to this guy at night.. Also, I know he will be dressed in his tailored suit at this bar. Any advice on what you think I should wear? How should I navigate the conversation to express my interest in him.?

No Spark with a Great Girl,"As a precursor, I am a 22 year old male who has had zero sexual (even kissing) experience prior to this event.

I met this amazing girl on a dating website a few weeks ago and hit it off on the first date (my first ever date). We arranged to meet again the following week, spending half the day together and we got on like a house on fire, even making plans for a third date. As the date was ending, I asked her if she'd be happy to go back to her place, as I felt really comfortable around her. Much to my surprise, she said yes and we proceeded to go to hers.

Once there, I made it really awkward straight away by trying to say I'd never done anything with a girl before. We proceeded to sit next to each other for an hour and a half watching Netflix. Personally, I didn't pick up on any signs that she wasn't enjoying this time together as we were both chatting and laughing. I really wanted to make a move but felt uncomfortable as: 1. didn't want to mess anything up, and 2. felt awkward in the situation as it was just me and her (as in, she's from miles out of town, living on her own, and I didn't want to do anything that would make her uneasy in her home). 

Now an hour and a half into watching Netflix, she explained that she was expecting me to make a move at some point, to which I replied I'd never even kissed before and was nervous, but that I'd like to kiss her. She was surprised that I'd not kissed before, and seemed disheartened because of this. Proceeding this, we kissed for about 10 seconds or so and she was clearly not impressed by my technique, but kept saying that she'd really like to get me through this. We tried kissing another 3 times and it was obviously not doing anything for her, and as such I kept saying that I was happy to leave if she wasn't feeling it, to which she would reply that she really wanted to get me through this first experience. After some discussion, she eventually agreed that I should probably go, and I left. 

SIDE STORY - I left my jumper at hers after leaving and rang her up about 20 minutes after, asking if I could come back to pick it up, which was a little embarrassing (got my jumper back tho)

It was absolutely eating me up that night as the main reason I'd never tried anything with a girl before was because I'd always wanted to experience things with someone who I cared for, and I didn't, and still don't want to sleep around to gain experience. This is a tad embarrassing, but because of this, I messaged her in the morning asking if she'd be happy to help me practice kissing as friends, even if she felt there was nothing there, as I wouldn't want to fail again with another girl who I liked this much. She replied saying that she didn't want to lead me on as she felt there was no spark there, but that I was a great guy and said to be more confident next time, and make a move earlier. I replied saying she's a great girl and happy that this embarrassing situation was with her.

I'd always wanted to have this spark with someone before, but am now uncertain on how to achieve this.

Here are my questions:

Was the lack of spark due to the lack of kissing experience, or the fact that I didn't try kissing her much earlier on at her place, even if the kiss would have been bad?

Is it completely over if there's no spark? All my friends say it's not, but I'd like the honest opinion of people who have no interest in my feelings. I don't want to be the guy that pesters, but if I were to gain more experience and felt I could have a spark with her in the future, is it worth messaging her a few months down the line saying I'd like to give it a go, or is it completely over after no spark? Because quite honestly, I'd forget my morals about sleeping around if it meant I could have another go with her. 

Any pointers for being more confident in these situations?

What is spark?

From what I heard it was expected she'd go nuts, although I was still  disappointed her character seemed to make such a U-turn, but again, I'm  not an expert on the show.

"I may have said something wrong to some friends, and I don‚Äôt know how to make things right","A few days ago, my friends (A, B, and C) and I were studying together at the library. For context, I was the only guy, and C is bisexual.

While we were taking a break from studying, and were chatting about some random stuff, A moved closer to B and began to hug her. This wasn‚Äôt anything out of the ordinary, as A enjoys physical contact. As we continued to talk, A moved her hands to B‚Äôs breast, and suddenly asked me if I was envious that she gets to touch B in such an intimate way.

I replied no, and I meant it. After all, I‚Äôve touched a woman‚Äôs breast before, and honestly didn‚Äôt think that it was that special. A proceeded to accuse me of lying, and said that I must be envious. She continued to ask me several times if I was envious of her.

After a short while, I replied ‚Äúprobably a little‚Äù. My reason for saying that is that I haven‚Äôt had physical contact with someone for quite a long time now, and to be honest, I was feeling really lonely, The fact that I was running a fever somehow added to the feeling of loneliness. So I was envious not because she got to touch B‚Äôs breast, but the physical contact that they had with one another.

Unfortunately, I may have made a mistake in saying ‚Äúprobably a little‚Äù. C is bisexual and has been crushing on B for a long time now. C has also been a real bro to me, helping me out on several occasions, and checking in on me via text when she knew I was sick. B has also been a really good friend to me. When we were studying at B‚Äôs house on one occasion, B kept brewing tea for me because she knew I was sick and wanted to drink something warm. The moment the words left my mouth, I saw a look of surprise and disappointment on C‚Äôs face. I supposed she felt betrayed?

I wanted to explain the reason behind my response, that it wasn‚Äôt sexual. But I decided against it as: (a) I couldn‚Äôt find the words to convey the emotions that I‚Äôm feeling, (b) I didn‚Äôt want to seem like a pussy for admitting that I‚Äôm lonely, and (c) I thought that explaining myself would make me look guilty.

Anyway, things seem to be a little weird between me and them (B and C) now. Our weekly schedules are highly similar, and as a result, the three of us used to hang out often. At times, they would proactively call me to ask me to hang out with them. However, it seems like things have changed. I tried to ask them out, but they didn‚Äôt seem particularly interested. I‚Äôm guessing they think that I‚Äôm some kind of pervert now? I‚Äôm not quite sure how to make things right between us.

P.S. I chose to post here as I've read multiple posts here on men who feel lonely due to a lack of physical contact, and I thought that you guys might be able to understand where I'm coming from. Hopefully, this is an appropriate subreddit.",AskMen,1558335128,AgreeableGrand,11,1,True,2019-05-19
Do you remember your first boner?,"Hi,

as the title suggest - do you?

&amp;#x200B;

I remember my first boner very vividly. I was younger than 7 but older than 5, which is a strange age to get a boner. But I swear I had one. It was a very strange feeling and an even stranger sight. 

My older brother was really into Metallica and since it was the 1999/2000 post-soviet country, only place to see a music video was MTV. So my brother was watching MTV and Metallica - Whiskey in the jar cover came up. I liked the song, I had heard it before so I watched the video. And oh my... The music video is very raunchy, the girls in it were acting very wild - drinking, smoking, and partying. I hadn't seen anything like it. I felt some kind of a rush in my nether region and my pants were starting to bulge. I had to run to the bathroom to see what's happening down there. I pulled my pants down and there it was. My very first boner. I remember having mixed feelings - shame, excitement, fear and happiness. I remember this moment even 20 years later.

Why am I such a wimp?,Roller coasters freak me out and heights and a few other things. Socially I can be assertive and brave but it‚Äôs more with physical things like extreme sports. Basically I will do them but I feel like I‚Äôm gonna collapse and start freaking out big time quietly. I try to act like it‚Äôs not the case but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm experiencing. Why am I naturally much more afraid of stuff and how can I get better? Over time I‚Äôve slowly challenged myself by going outside of my comfort but I think my starting point is way worse than most guys. Most of my friends will hop on some gnarly rollercoaster or surf a reef break while smiling. That‚Äôs just not me right now. I don‚Äôt want to be a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù but I really feel like one sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm a Social Media manager 

&amp;#x200B;

I have this client who‚Äôs too focused on Twitter even though he has Facebook &amp; Instagram 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I found out that I should post whatever I post in Twitter in all other social media platforms!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôve been in this job for 2 months and I don‚Äôt know how I missed that, no one told me and I didn‚Äôt know!! I swear I didn‚Äôt!

&amp;#x200B;

Now it‚Äôs too late to fix it because there‚Äôs no way you could post in Facebook in whatever date you want, and the client will find out about it and he might leave us, and I can assure that the company values their clients more than their employees, and this client is not satisfied and I‚Äôm afraid if he leaves our company they‚Äôll make it on me

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm going to get fired, it‚Äôs 7 AM and my work starts at 9 and I don‚Äôt want to go, I haven‚Äôt slept all night because of this and I want to cry 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôll own my mistake, I‚Äôll tell them it won‚Äôt happen again-because seriously I don‚Äôt want to put myself into this position ever again-

but I don‚Äôt know how to fix it, I‚Äôm afraid that if I apologized they‚Äôll tell me: ‚Äúand so what? What can we do with your apology if we can‚Äôt fix this?‚Äù

How to deal with a condescending upper management? Been at the job for 4 years. Am the lead.,"There's 3 of them; owners of the company and the boss.  Boss has some bipolar tendencies; sometimes condescending, many times gives incorrect information.  The owners (husband/wife), are condescending.  Boss is actually fed up with the owners.  Many changes in the last 6 months resulted in everyone being overworked and being given unreasonable workloads and deadlines.  Too focused in numbers.  One guy already quit.

Any advice on why (35M) he doesn‚Äôt compliment (28F) me?,"Casually talking to an eligible bachelor. He can be kind of back and forth in how much affection he shows me. I‚Äôm MAJORLY confused. 

Things started to heat up between us and he started to open up. Loved it because I like him and was open to building a friendship that lead to a relationship. Seemed healthy. 

Well he got very excited about my performance in bed and it was all he could really talk about. A fair amount of men tend to rave about our experiences together. But it was annoying because I‚Äôd chosen him because I thought he could keep his cool. So I kind of snapped at him, I got sensitive from all the crude sex talk and completely went off. I don‚Äôt normally carry myself as a wild woman (it‚Äôs just a bedroom thing) so I felt disrespected that he‚Äôd be so vulgar. 

It definitely changed the dynamic of our relationship but I had to stand up for my standards and how I like to be treated even if it was Benedict Cumberbatch. 

He went back to a former position of not showing affection and it dampened things for me. Anywho, during this time I‚Äôve had some major developments in my career. He‚Äôs been kept abreast and actively follows what I‚Äôm doing in this area (the goal being to raise funds for research) . Well, I received the major funding in my space and about twenty mins later I got a text from him stating, something to the effect of closing the gap and how I‚Äôm going to handle the work load. I‚Äôd had this feeling that he was holding back for all these months but I kept thinking maybe he doesn‚Äôt view this as an appropriate moment to be considerably kind. But once this happened, I knew that in this moment, something was very wrong here. 

I was kind of blown. I‚Äôd worked very hard and this was something definitely worth a congrats and he blew right past it. No acknowledgement on my effort or praise. But it‚Äôs weird because he‚Äôll literally send me articles on my space, give advice, and track my career events. 

Is this him being hot/cold? And if so, how can I create a space where he feels comfortable congratulating me on my successes and complimenting me as a kick ass woman?

What Happened?,"So I‚Äôll try to just summarize this and keep it short and hopefully someone got something for me. 

Around November this girl began to come around to my frat house and she would like talk to me and kind of separated me away so we would have like one on one talks. Fun shit. I told this as a sign then she was into me and after we began hanging out and chilling in each others rooms I told her I liked her. I panicked and told her I like her over Snap but let her know that I wanted to say it in person. But she told me that she needed time for herself cause of personal issues and that like we still should be around each other. So I said cool nothing assuming it was a rejection and when we got back it was business as usual. Hanging out, chilling, talking a lot over Snap. Became her best friend and got the red heart shit. 
She would drunkenly tell me how she felt and that I was perfect. She would always trail over though and would say except for...
She then got a boyfriend when she left for another break we had. He was from back home and stuff. 

Guys, was I just being used as a time-waster?

Like  I‚Äôm not under the disillusion that she‚Äôll pick me now that she‚Äôs single again. Hell, apparently she forgets everything that we‚Äôve ever talked about to one another.

My ex has been trying to get with me again and wants to meet up tomorrow. A week ago I started chatting with a woman and we get along so much better than my ex and I. We relate to each other much more and have intelligent, thought-provoking conversation. My ex and I do not have that at all and never have. She cannot keep up and doesn't even try to.

But.

Her body is 10/10 for me. Dark hair, cute but sexy face, wide hips, THICC butt, perfect pussy lips, flexible as a gymnast, medium tits and maintains 10 extra pounds that I think are just perfect.

New girl has a pretty face, big titties, holding onto probably 45 extra pounds that don't sit quite right and shes heavier in the first place because shes tall, she's too heavy for me to move around properly, I'm strong but not a power lifter. And she isn't flexible at all. 

But.

Am I right to be a angry if an adult doesn't have any money? Not even $20. Please read before responding.,"Dear Reddt,

Today, I became upset yet again for the million time. The issue is that my brothers  (both in their 30's) do not contribute in absolutely anything in our house. One of them with 4 kids just moved out 2 weeks ago, but the other is still here. My issue is that they always use the excuse that they don't have money to not pay for anything.

This has been an ongoing issue for the past 10 years or so. The same excuse is used over and over again. They basically live for free and even then are always complaining they don't have money.

Just today I complained to my brother that I don't care if he has no money or what his excuse is for not to have money and he tried to make himself the victim. I would understand if it is only once in a while or every couple of weeks, but no, it is the same, old excuse.

As adults in their 30's, they should have at least money to at least pay at least (not even all the bills) to pay some bills. Even more, they are grown up men in their 30's who are healthy. No physical or mental disability, strong and tall. I don't see a reason why they should not have at least money to even cover their own expenses.

If I was to be serious with a guy, I dont care if the guy is not rich or drives and older car, but for heaven's sake, I can't stand a grown up adult, especially a guy saying they don't have even $20.

My brother was telling me I was being too rough and heartless and I simply telling back that I am tired of the same s...t and story. Please provide with your opions if I have the right to be angry or if they are right.",AskMen,1555731751,Skzone5,1,1,True,2019-04-19

What happened to my self confidence?,"Hey fellow men, I‚Äôll try to keep this short. I‚Äôm a short dude, around 5‚Äô6, with a rather long torso and short legs. I never used to care about my height, figuring it didn‚Äôt matter (because it doesn‚Äôt). But for some reason, recently I‚Äôve noticed my depression getting worse and my self confidence just dropping so much. I keep thinking ‚Äúmaybe if I were taller things would be better, chicks would notice me more‚Äù or whatever, on some self pity bullshit. I know it‚Äôs not the case, but being a college student where relationships aren‚Äôt nearly as common as hook ups, it‚Äôs hard to have confidence when I know there‚Äôs 15 other dudes trying to get with the same chick, and they could easily be taller, better looking, more athletic, whatever. 

I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre not me, and I know I‚Äôm awesome despite having low self confidence and not really believing it. Deep deep down I do know I am, because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve felt before. But not anymore. 

I don‚Äôt want this to come off as me pissing and moaning about how women only go for tall guys, because they don‚Äôt.

"Feeling generally down and like I've been wasting my life at 22 years old, what can I do to change this mentality?","I'm about to turn 22 in a few weeks and I feel really old and I feel like I've been living a boring life and just wasting away. I got accepted into a highly globally ranked college, and I've been studying ever since. I got one more year ahead of me (I'll graduate as soon as I turn 23) and I'm in a competitive program in the tech field that leaves me in front of the computer most of my days. Most of all I still live at home since my family bought a house close to the college when we moved a few years back with hopes that i'd get into the college (thank god I did I guess), I plan to move out after I graduate but I feel like such shit.

I spend most of my days studying or working to increase my knowledge in other fields such as programming and etc to better my self and increase my chances of getting a great job right out of college. My daily routine consists of going to school, going to the gym, coming home right after, planning my meals and studying, sleep, repeat.

I feel as if I don't have much friends other than the select few that I still talk to from high school and occasionally play video games with. This college also has multiple campuses throughout the area. The one that I go to is the smallest one and is in a residential area meaning there's just one building for dorms on the campus. This means most of the people are commuters who simply come and go to school and never stays longer than needed. I'm exactly like this as well. To top it all off, me and my gf of a year and a half just ended it a few months ago and I was so consumed with her that I didn't really make friends after I met her leaving me kind of feeling pretty damn lonely after we ended it.

Overall, I just don't feel good. I'm sick of studying, I'm sick of feeling lonely, and I feel like everyone at this point already has their friend groups and as weird as it sounds I feel like I don't even know how to make friends anymore...

As for feeling old, every time I see something that reminds me of when i was a teenager such as a tv show or a song I'd listen to, I'd think about what I imagined then what my life would be like at 21 and such. And to be honest life is kind of shittier than when I was a kid in high school.

He was the one who decided to break things off so that we could both focus on ourselves first. We‚Äôre both in places in our lives right now where we have a lot of our own problems to deal with (especially with our own selves). We were pulling each other down and I understand why we had to end it.

"Men, please can you explain what goes through your head if you haven't gotten over the pain of a previous relationship break up (over the person, just not the pain) but get feelings for someone else and date them for a while but then suddenly tell them you don't want a relqtionship?","I have been seeing a guy since December. We both started by saying we wanted to be exclusive but didn't necessarily want a relationship. I know he was extremely hurt by his last relationship break up and I don't think he processed the pain very well, he turned to alcohol and drugs (recreationally, but rather often). 

Anyway, we've had conversations about wanting it to go somewhere and he told me he was scared and to make a move. I was scared to as I've been hurt as well but told him I wanted to be his girlfriend at some point. He said he wanted that too someday. Things increased in intensity and we were on the cusp on being in a relationship after dating for 4 months. Suddenly he got depressed and hardly spoke as often as usual. We had a couple conversations where he said it wasn't to do with me. Then bam, the other day he said he has feelings for me (I don't know how strong, but I have fallen in love with him, I've known him since August) but it'll never be more for him. We spoke about it and he isn't willing to roll the dice and risk getting hurt in a relationship again, the trust and everything is too much for him in general and it's not just about me. (I know some girls he's dated before who warned me he was like this but idk why, I thought maybe it would be different with me, stupid I know but we do have chemistry and a connection we both have never had before). 

I just am struggling because I feel like either he has cut and run now before his feelings get too deep because he doesn't want to risk hurting himself, or he was never as into me as I was him and I'm just a fool now left in love with someone who wasted my time. I feel so hurt because I really thought we could have something amazing and I know he felt the same way at some point. 

Even if he one day changes his mind, I think his pride would get in the way of telling me just in case I said it was too late. But he will always be the one that got away for me.",AskMen,1555761827,Chicken_Chaser_Fable,1,1,True,2019-04-20

I was going down on her and I felt something weird, on my face, so putting my fingers in her I felt this condom in her snatch. I pulled this thing out of her and she just started crying, saying it only happened once on the Friday night and they used a condom because she cared about me...so this makeshift petri dish of her lovers spunk had been living up there, in her trifling snatch all weekend &amp; my tongue released the kraken...

"Have you ever felt jealous when someone you consider a close friend interacts with someone he/she considers a closer, funnier friend?","Not sure if I'm just in my head about this, or just being silly and irrational, etc but a few days ago I hung out with my friend Ben and his girlfriend + two other friends,  Rob and Tom. 

Ben and Rob were coworkers for a while and according to Ben's girlfriend, he and Rob were inseparable when they were together. Always crackin jokes, same interests for the most part, etc. I guess they stopped hanging out as much after a bit and I got in the picture after finding out that Ben lives nearby and we hit it off immediately and start hanging out often. Few mins away from my house. I sense some kind of connection. Like a long lost friend connection with this dude, and I consider him a close friend now. Super comfortable, never weird, always fun. We introduced our girlfriends, we all hang out, it's fun. I basically now consider him a brother and I think about him often to hang, etc. Kind of like that summer vibe where all you wanna do is go over to your buddy's every day and do stuff. He has three older brothers, I have no brothers just older sisters. 

So one day we all hang out. Ben and his girlfriend. Rob and Tom. I notice Ben and Rob really hitting it off, cracking jokes, some jokes I don't get which is chill, just a different vibe. Now I feel excluded. I notice how much harder he laughs around Rob, how much more free he feels around him kind of, or comfortable maybe. They're both white too, I'm not, which shouldn't be an issue but I feel like it's a necessary detail to add I guess, because it gives context. 

Throughout the day I crack a few jokes, my girl isn't there so I'm feeling a little lonely and out of place all of a sudden. we smoke and drink. Feeling a little weird and not used to this dynamic. I try to crack some jokes that nobody really laughs to, now I'm feeling stupid and self conscious. We go to Robs house and they discuss Catholicism and wonder why it's so common for Mexicans to be Catholic. Ben's girlfriend mentions to them that they should ask me since I'm Mexican and now I'm singled out as the only Mexican in the room with the idea that I should know why Catholicism is so prevalent in Mexico but I dont. 

Is this a race thing? I was wondering why Ive become so attached to my friend Ben and why I felt jealous at times and singled out and excluded after his old pal came in the pic again. Don't get me wrong I like them all but these particular instances wherei felt singled out was just weird. And I felt hurt.

What does this girl want?,"Tl;Dr: Friends for years, lots of bidirectional flirting and attempts on my side to start dating, fantastic conversations, but she dodges or refuses to actually date when queried. Is she just a tease, seriously interested in something long-term but timing is wrong, or just friends..?  


\-----

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been friends with this girl for around 6 years since college. Back then, she was interested in this guy and I liked her, but not really knowing how to flirt at the time, I instead played in the game of hooking her up with him (it was a rather bizarre situation tbh). Eventually they start dating and have the usual on-and-off-again relationship for a few years. During this period (while they were broken up), we start texting a little and it feels like flirting, but I don't really know and we're both busy at our own internships and it fizzles down after a while. She moved to a different state for work, I moved to another.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, around 2 years ago we start talking in earnest over Facebook and became very good friends - we're both in tech, both trying to start our own companies, both spend a lot of time thinking about the future and life, both workaholics. We have fantastic conversations - she's easily one of my favorite people to talk to. She also drew me to Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, we've continued to talk a lot - but often with long gaps where we won't talk for months during which we'll suddenly schedule a video chat and seemingly talk for hours. In the last two years, we've both dated other people on and off. Around a year ago, it really seemed like we might start dating - we started talking more regularly and some suggestive/flirty snaps were sent back and forth. I've liked her romantically throughout most of this, and her snaps seemed like pretty strong indications she liked me, but when asked pretty pointedly if she wanted to go out, she dodged the question.  


In the last couple months, she was dating this one guy after being mostly single for a long time and I somehow wound up being her 'gay bestfriend' that she vented to about all her problems with him - which was particularly awkward since I pretty openly still had feelings for her. I started casually dating new people (Tinder) without a lot of 2nd dates (my choice - I want conversations like I have with this girl but have yet to find them) and eventually she broke up with her most recent boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in the last few weeks, we've started seriously flirting again, culminating in a 2 hour video chat on Saturday before last where all indications seemed to suggest we might date. However, her current argument is essentially that she thinks if we dated it'd be amazing, but we'd have some big fight after 6 months and she would 'not know who she is anymore'. Also, the timing seemed off (she just broke up with her ex and is largely consumed by her work and ambitions), so we didn't decide to start dating. Since then, I've gone back to casually dating and I've told her high-level details (generally boiling down to 'date was meh - not going on another' ) of my dates because she asked and told me she wants me to be more open. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last Friday though she started yet again being suddenly distant and we've essentially not talked since except sending each other the occasional interesting reddit post. I'm not really sure what to do at this point. This seems to happen often where she'll suddenly become distant or short with me and frankly, it stresses me out and I have no idea what to do. Eventually, I always seem to be the one to rekindle our conversations after they've died, but I kind of resent the fact that I'm always the one who's expected to extend the olive branch (even though we weren't actually fighting in the first place).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, sorry for the lengthy story. I adore this girl, but it's impossible for me to tell if she wants to be together, just friends, or what, but our relationship is peculiar and I figured, 'YOLO, why not ask the internet?'.

&amp;#x200B;

What the heck does this girl want?? Am I just target of a multi-year tease? Does she want a relationship but really is waiting for the right timing? (in which case, am I expected to wait in the meanwhile for her?) Or is she interested, but not enough to try to start something she things will become to complicated? (in which case, should I just move on?)

Flirting with no intention of it going anywhere,"Hi Men of Reddit!
I need you opinions...
I have flirted plenty of times with guys in bars and whatnot, but I have run into something new. 
I am traveling for work and one of the guys from a different branch has been flirting with me for a few days. He is nice and attractive, but I have no intention of this going anywhere. I am leaving to go home at the end of this week and I doubt I will ever see him again. I am however feeling guilty because he seems to really like me and I feel like I might be leading him on...
The flirting isn't too intense, just some hair flips and joking over my abysmal pool abilities at the bar after work. But it has been multiple days in a row now, and it is more prolonged flirting than a random guy in a bar for one night. So is what I am doing wrong? Should I stop? We made plans to play one last time tomorrow night and I feel like he might try to take it farther and I really am not comfortable with that, and while i know he would respect 'no' i would still feel badly about it...",AskMen,1554444282,spoiledbutawesome,33,1,True,2019-04-04

What is your definition of checking someone out?," 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking, because I don't think I check out other women while I am dating my current GF, at least not in the way most men on Reddit seem to define it? So I feel like there might be something wrong with me. I am a bit socially awkward so apologies if this post seems weird to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I definitely do find women other than my GF attractive. But if anything, I'll see them, my mind for a split second (or a second, don't measure) will go ""She's got a really nice face, lips, eyes"" etc. or whatever. But that's it. I move on, no different as if my mind acknowledged a red truck or a cute dog passing by etc.

I don't ever fantasize about them, or picture them naked, or wonder what they will be like in bed etc. I acknowledge and admire their attractiveness for a split second before just.. moving on with my day. No sexual thoughts.

So, is my definition of checking out wrong, and I have been all this time? (Not that I would feel bad about it)

Or, should I get my testosterone levels checked?

Or is this more common than I thought in men in relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

For more information, I have had sex about 4 times a week in most of my relationships. They all have lasted at least a year.

Am I a loser?,"Hello everyone,

I hope everyone is doing good and having a good day. I am a 25-year-old male who is still living at home with mom and dad. I am at the point in my life that I am starting to become mentally depressed over this due to my self-evaluation. I‚Äôve read articles explaining how any young adult who is still living at home after the age of 23 is considered to be a low life or someone who is a failure.

Let me explain a little about myself. Ever since I was eighteen years old I have been working full-time jobs and part-time jobs. During my high school times I never once thought about my future or college. I never even considered what I even wanted to do. I just worked, to be honest. Then we as a family moved to Georgia since my father‚Äôs parents who are my Grandparents became sick. I was twenty-one years old when we moved to Georgia. During this time I went to a technical school to attain my fire certifications to get on with a fire department. After school, I landed a job at a fire department at the age of twenty-one since the school was only one semester. During the job, I was sent to EMT school to attain that and after attaining my EMT I was working as a Firefighter/EMT. While running emergency calls I realized how much I enjoyed the medical field and taking care of patients. This led me to want to pursue a degree in nursing. I was twenty-two years old and when I turned twenty-three I ended up getting fired from the job due to conflicting interest with the job and my pursuit with nursing. I was upset with this because I was attending nursing school part-time while working full-time and they fired me just because they say me planning on leaving after attaining my nursing. After this, I had a vehicle that was paid off but ended up totaling it due to weather conditions and my lack of maturity. I regret this completely but there is nothing I can do. When it ended up getting totaled and I achieved the money back I used it to pay off my student loans. The crappy part is I did not end up attaining my nursing degree because recently my parents are planning on moving to Pennsylvania. I was twenty-four now working full-time for an ambulance company making 13.50 an hour. Two months before I turn 25 I landed a seat in a paramedic course. Now I am in paramedic school as a stepping stone to get back on with a good fire department and eventually use it to get my nursing. I am now working in a low-income fire department while going through the process of getting on with a better one right now and working my part-time ambulance job.

I am saving up for a vehicle right now that is going to be cheap. Roughly 4‚Äì8k most. Other than a car payment I will not have any debt. My student loans and paramedic school are all paid off. I have made my mistakes in the past but I just wish I could make up for it. I feel like a loser and a bum. I am working roughly 60+ hours a week between my fire department job and ambulance job.

I am also a big advocate of Dave Ramsey and listening to his podcasts. Recently I have been coming across some of his videos explaining how young adults living with there parents should move out and should not be with there parents. He is a big advocate that young adults should be out of parents house before 21 and anything about that starts to become a burden on the parents.

My first job only pays me $10.00 an hour and I work 240 hours a month. My second job only pays me $13.50 and I work roughly 80-100 hours a week. As of right now this is my only two jobs and I am honestly considering looking for another night time job but then I would be working so much I wouldn't have any time to really study for my paramedic course and I wouldn't be sleeping much.

The thing that is preventing me from moving out right now is my clinical that will be starting in May. I have requirements that will be needed to check off and sadly all my shifts will be a minimum of 12 hours long. Clinicals can take two months or 6 months because it all comes down to the day. An example of this would be having to attain 40 pediatric assessments and its not very often that a pediatric comes into a hospital. What makes it even harder is here at my school we do not have the chance to do some of our clinical at a children's hospital since the school does not have a contract with one.

I do however want to work for this one company in Texas that pays for paramedics starting at $60,500. While working for this company I wanted to bridge from my paramedic to RN and then work as an RN full time while working part-time for the other company. I'll be having two retirements going and then ill be finishing up my schooling getting my BSN from my ADN and then from that point on ill be making the choice if I want to pursue my masters in NP or stay at the nurse level.

My future to me sounds good and I'm excited for it but its my past that makes me depressed. I wish I would have either joined the military when I was 18 or 21. Or I wish I would of went to college earlier and did my nursing when I was 18 or 21. Since I did not do this I turned into a bum still having to live at home withy parents until I finish off paramedic school because apartments here range from 980-1200 for just a one bedroom. There are no studios anywhere near me. I also tried renting a room but none of my friends want to do that and I am not going to lie when I say I am not a huge fan of randomly finding someone on the internet.

Society has this stigma that anyone over the age of 25 still living at home with mom and dad are considered bums and losers. This thought never leaves me mind and it really tears me down emotionally and mentally.",AskMen,1553209106,LoadingMedic,1,1,True,2019-03-21

What would you like to read in a love letter?,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I need some advice!  My boyfriend's birthday is coming up, and he HATES getting gifts; has absolutely forbade me to buy him anything.  Ah ha!  But!  Love letters cost nothing, and his main objection to gifts is that they're wasteful and don't mean very much.  So, to me, a love letter seems like the perfect thing - I acknowledge his birthday, and give him something (hopefully) meaningful, without spending any money.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem:  I don't know what to write.  Basically, I have ""You are the best"" and ""I love doing the sex with you.""  I know what \*I\* would want to read, but that's not necessarily what will make him feel special and treasured.  He doesn't talk about feelings much, so I don't have a good read on what to write.

&amp;#x200B;

So, men of reddit, what would you like to hear?  To me, he is the best part of my life, and I want to let him know.

I used to be moderately muscular and I want to get back to that, but I've just been nervous to do regular workouts like squats, bench press, and really anything that engages my core.

I don't feel like I'm being unreasonable by asking to message for a little bit first before meeting up. A lot of times, guys will remind me that I'm on a dating app and the whole point is to meet up. I do understand that, I'm just really cautious. Sometimes they will agree to talk to me but then just a day or two later are asking if we can meet yet. I just need more time. Maybe online dating just isn't for me? How much time is an acceptable amount of time to talk before meeting before it gets to the point where I really am being unreasonable?

We went out on our first date after talking for a few weeks and building up a great chemistry. She wanted to make out after the first date - I refused. On our third date, she wanted to make out again. I told her that I had feelings for her and I wanted to take things slower to see how this progresses. She asked me if I wanted us to be exclusive and I said likely yes, but I'd like to continue to know each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's been two months and a lot of conversations since, and she's told me a bunch of times that she loves me. It feels like we are dating, and we've been hanging out whenever we can, and texting each other all day long. She'd ask me to stay for the night, cook for me, would remind of me things, etc. Nothing out of the ordinary for two people in a relationship.

Yesterday, she asked me what I was looking for and I told her that I liked where we are currently. She then told me that she wanted to explore other guys as well and didn't want exclusivity yet. She didn't know what she wanted in a guy yet. I told her that if that was what she wanted, it's her prerogative to go ahead with it - just that I would tone down my own stance on our dating.

How do I show love to a man with an avoidant attachment style?,"I have been dating this guy for a little under a year and he‚Äôs funny, interesting and intelligent, but it seems like he has a hard time expressing serious emotions? He often says serious things while smiling like he‚Äôs trying to joke about it but I can tell his family issues bother him.

He tends to abuse alcohol but always makes it look like he‚Äôs just having fun. It‚Äôs so often though that I have asked him if he‚Äôs okay multiple times and he just looks at me all silly and says, ‚ÄúYeah, why??‚Äù

It‚Äôs hard for me to comfort him because when I try to have the serious discussion and be there for him after he brings up some situation, he immediately shuts down and becomes obviously preoccupied with the show we‚Äôre watching or a game he‚Äôs playing to avoid continuing the conversation.

I've been a makeup artist for 10 years, it's a huge part of my life and I love it. I don't wear makeup because I think I'm ugly or in need of fixing, it's a for of self expression and it's also artistry.

I always felt like she was the one that got away. But she's been wanting to Hang out with me a lot lately and we continue to. Last night, I picked her up and we were just driving around, listening to music, and talking about each others lives. Got some food(she paid for it). We spent a good 2 hours together. I feel like I could have hooked up with her if I wanted to, but I maintained my self control. She snapchats me a lot and we talk a lot. Her friend told me that she wants to stay as friends and possibly get a deeper connection after prom. I just feel that a girl that has done all this with me, and I've had a past with doesn't want to stay ""just friends"". Im asking because I invited her to my house this weekend to watch a movie and wonder what she would be thinking at the moment.

What do Men Think of Blonde Asians? (Serious),"May seem arbitrary, but I was just curious as to what men (of all races and ages) think of Asian American women who dye their hair blonde. Is it a turn off? Does it not matter at all? Is it something you see on the Internet but don't often in real time?

There is a stereotype that Asian women who dye their hair blonde want to be white and have a lot of internalized self-hatred. But I want to break away from that stereotype, and suggest that we may want to dye our hair just for a fashion trend, to follow K-pop trends, or just want to try on something different. 

I recently dyed my hair, and I personally believe it suits my skin tone and facial features better than any other color I've tried. I've been very careful about protecting my hair after the bleaching with lots of serums, conditioners, and little to no heat. So I was just wondering what men in general think about it :) Please state your age and ethnicity.

Why is it so difficult to move on sometimes?,"Im pretty sure i fell for a coworker of mine some months ago and have been trying to get over it the last few months with no success. Other girls dont compare to her for some reason, i always catch myself thinking of her when i know i shouldn't. 

Ive tried tinder, bumble, going out, focusing on school, everything. I cant seem to shake it. Id consider us friends but just barely. I dont know why or how i fell so hard it just happened but saldy an US is never going to happen.

A female friend of mine confirmed with her she is not looking for anybody and has no desire for anything to even happen naturally. I can 100% respect that as i have been in the same boat and sometimes people just need their space and want to focus on themselves. 

Im content with waiting but its definitely not the easiest nor the healthiest thing to do. I want to try asking her out just so she can say no and i can try moving on but id still like to be friends with her regardless although i feel like in her experience guys only want to be friends with her just to sleep with her.

Excuse the rant and venting but im struggling here to find a way to let these feelings sort themselves out or just thrash what could be an awesome friendship.

I just need advice/help in trying to deal with and or resolve all these jumbled thoughts of feeling shameful for having feelings yet truly wanting to be friends.",AskMen,1550548790,GilbyPlease,2,2,True,2019-02-18

I (26/f) think I scared my now ex-bf (24/m) away unintentionally...help?," 

Things with my boyfriend had been good and we were making some future plans together (he talked about flying his parents in so I could meet them finally) and he was planning a trip for us to Milwaukee, WI for a weekend in February. We celebrated 8 months on the 8th and I thought our relationship was headed in the right direction... over that weekend (weekend before Valentine's Day), I was telling him how a lot of my close friends are moving in together, getting engaged, getting married, having kids... specifically, I mentioned that my best guy friend just bought a ring and moved in with his gf after 7 months. It wasn't supposed to hint at anything, just was a conversation, wherein I mentioned how I was excited for them. I think he started to overthink everything, because, the next day, he texted me saying we had to end things because he didn't think he ever wanted to get married or have kids (this contradicted everything else he or his closest friends said throughout our relationship--his friends would talk about how my ex was building a future with me, how he talked about marrying me, how he wanted to be the dad that was the coach, how we'd make cute kids, etc), so I was left very confused. I feel like he thought I was trying to push the relationship and set up some sort of timeline...making it seem like everything wasn't good enough just the way it was... that was never my intention; I've always wanted things to unfold naturally/organically. I feel like I really scared him away unintentionally, and now I don't know what to do. I tried to reach out to him this past weekend after giving it a week, and he didn't answer my call or call me back. I guess I'm looking for a little guidance from a guy's perspective on what I should be doing in this situation...I'm pretty upset/confused/heartbroken.

Why do my friends just want to have sex all the time?,"Title is a little weird because I didn't know what else to put. For context I'm a 20 year old guy in college with a gf of 6 years. So something I don't seem to understand is why it seems like almost every guy I know is always just chasing tail. It always seems to me that to me. I've been with my girlfriend for a long time and ever since about 3 years ago we've been at it in the sack non-stop up until maybe a year ago. Like I don't know what It is but I don't really feel the want to have sex all the time, and its the same for her. Don't get me wrong we're both really good in bed and we always have a good time. But yeah maybe once a week we'll do it but I'd much rather prefer to do other stuff like cook or play video games or watch movies or go out that have sex. Now don't get me wrong I still think my girlfriend looks hot as hell and I don't really I really find her more attractive than most other women, but this is where things get weird. Like if I was with a group of friends (all single, none of them ever in a serious relationship, mostly the smash and pass kinda guys) recently and our sex lives came up and they asked about mine (and we're all really close so I didn't mind talking about it) so I told them that the last time we had sex was like two weeks ago and they all looked at me like I had a dick growing out of my forehead. For some reason they couldn't comprehend not wanting to have sex even given the opportunity. One of them even joked and said ""damn guys, watch out, I think hes turning gay on us"". It got a chuckle out of me but like it just further adds to my confusion. So what I'm wondering is, is it normal for guys to think that way? or is it just younger guys? or are me and my gf just weird that we don't have sex on a daily basis?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Good friends think it's weird me and my gf don't have sex all the time, say if they had gf's they would have sex every day given the opportunity. ",AskMen,1550566769,Arisal1122,7,1,True,2019-02-19

"Guys, what would you want a girl to do in this situation?","Don't want to go into too much detail because I don't know if this guy uses Reddit. Started chatting to a guy about a month ago, he's absolutely wonderful, lovely and funny. Not emotionally available as a woman he loved broke his heart via ghosting and blocking on social media. We slept together a few times, spoke every day, he confided some personal family things to me, and one day he went from being happy and enthusiastic, to just down. At the gym he'd come to me mid workout to say hi/bye and have a conversation, but he stopped initiating conversation and didn't ask to see me anymore. When I asked him what was wrong, he said he needed time to sort out his feelings, would be putting himself out of the relationship game for at least 6 months-ish. Us sleeping together made the reality of his emotional attachment to the ex and what she did to him much more intense. I offered space, and to not bother him with communication, but he said he still wanted to talk because he liked talking to me, but told me upfront that he didn't want to hurt my feelings by prolonging communication when he's sure it wasn't going to lead to anything right now. I respect his needs, and I guaranteed him it wouldn't hurt me if we kept talking and it went nowhere, because I just liked talking to him too. He was happy with this. 

I don't want this guy out of my life because he's a genuinely lovely person, and I've been single for about 5 months after a horrible break up. It's nice to have that presence in my life again even if he isn't a boyfriend and probably won't be. I haven't been in this kind of situation before - I don't know how to behave now. I want to msg but I know I should leave days in between. I want to ask him out for a drink but I know this isn't a likely possibility.

Problems studying hard with condoms??,"Hi guys!

I‚Äôve been talking to a great girl and we tried to have sex (and kind of did??) yesterday, but with a lot of difficulty.

So, maybe it was performance anxiety and maybe not, but I used a lubricated condom that is supposedly the safest on the market. I‚Äôve used them with a lot of girls in the past including regularly with an ex of two years, but the last few times I‚Äôve used this brand have been difficult.

So to put it simply, I couldn‚Äôt stay hard during sex. I was able to put the condom on and stay in missionary for a bit but I ‚Äúgot soft‚Äù every time we tried to switch positions, the condom was all loose (maybe due to the inside spermicide lubrication stuff??) and I couldn‚Äôt get hard again. We kinda made out for a bit and eventually got it to work. I had the same difficulties soon after we ‚Äúmade it work‚Äù, and then my problem went away... (cause the damn thing broke)

Anyway, what‚Äôs the best way to get rid of this? My most recent relationship was pretty much all raw sex so that may be my problem in comparison??

I sometimes Juul and have read that nicotine could harm erections so I‚Äôm quitting that, and I‚Äôm going to stop masturbating entirely and see if that helps the issue. I‚Äôm going to pick up other condoms that don‚Äôt have all this extra lubrication, and see if that helps as well, but do you guys have any other tips? I‚Äôm 22 and am really hoping that i don‚Äôt have any ed problems just yet, but it worries me because I used to regularly use this brand and exact same type, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to blow it with this girl because of something stupid like this",AskMen,1549263778,DatingThrowaway2222,1,1,True,2019-02-03

How do I [20F] make friends of the opposite sex who don‚Äôt want to fuck me?,"Hi! I have trouble making friends with people of the opposite sex and I was looking for input and advice. (I hope nothing I say is mistaken for arrogance or tooting my own horn! Just giving context)

I am a single, above average looking girl who puts effort into her appearance. I wear minimal makeup and dress sophisticatedly unlike people in my classes who just wear sweats and dirty tees. Personality-wise I am outgoing and friendly with everyone. I am charismatic, cheeky, and am told that I am a great conversationalist/listener. I guess all of these qualities make me a dick magnet. 

I am the kind of person who genuinely cares what people have to say and enjoy people‚Äôs company. When I talk to people, I give them my undivided attention or exhibit open body language (ie: body facing the other person), but I subconsciously do these things out of respect. I understand that all of these behaviors can give people the impression that I‚Äôm interested in them romantically. I‚Äôve tried being more cold or act disinterested, but i feel more disconnected and lonely with these shallow interactions, and like I‚Äôm being a bitch quite honestly. It may also be true that some of these guys just aren‚Äôt used to having girls talk to them and show interest in them in any way. 

The cycle is usually making conversation with a classmate and being acquaintances or friends, we study together, and then them either sending weird texts, asking me out, or asking to hook up. Somewhere down the line (very early on usually) I can tell that they like me though. I usually abandon that relationship because I know where it‚Äôs going, or I let them know we are going out as friends when they ask me out. And then they get pissed at me or act weird afterwards, thus creating yet another awkward relationship with a classmate in my small major. (Relationship as in general relation, not romantic). I feel so isolated. 

It‚Äôs disappointing to think you‚Äôre making a friend, when the other person‚Äôs agenda is to keep holding on until they get an opportunity to fuck you. I try to act cordial, but I feel so lonely like I have no real friends. I‚Äôve always had a problem keeping ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù with people of the opposite sex because I am an open person. And it doesn‚Äôt help that in engineering, the majority of the class is male. How do I set the tone from the beginning?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about your looks, it‚Äôs about the vibe you put off‚Äù.

Style is about average I‚Äôd say. I‚Äôm planning on getting some nicer stuff once I get a better job. Otherwise, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm average to slightly above fashion wise.

"Men with multiple passions, how did you solve the paradox of choice?","How did you pick that 'one passion'? If not, how did you manage being torn by different interests? 


BACKGROUND:

I thought I was done with this part of my life. I'm 20 with three months left in college (competitive engineering degree).

From 16-18 years old, I lived and breathed music. I joined a band and practiced as much as I could. From 19-20, I spent most of my time learning literature and screenwriting, keeping my musical aspirations at the back of my head and thinking I will do that later. All the while, I didn't put my studies aside. 

Now that I'm about to graduate college, I feel like I have to come to a conclusion on what I really wanted to do (be good at). I have a notion that if I keep on switching between multiple interests, I will never excel in any one. 

Anybody who had been in similar cases? What's your story? ",AskMen,1547973489,supersonder,35,1,True,2019-01-20
When did your personality mostly mature?,"When I was 16, I moved countries and into a new high school.

I grew up in a dysfunctional home but I was also pretty sheltered because I grew up in a small town and was immature (I didn't think things through) and had relatively poor social skills. At the time, most of my peers didn't like me and I couldn't understand why. I became traumatised by my new high school experience, because in my previous school, I was the popular one and now I was the weird outcast. At that time, I felt like everyone was out to get me, but in hindsight they gave me lots of chances and tried to include me but I just misread them and looked for every possible hint of social rejection.

It's not until 5 years later (with intensive therapy and self help books plus some more socialisation) that I now realise that their maturity level back then is what mine is currently now. Now my mind is crystal clear and I can easily connect with people nowadays whereas before, I had this permanent fog to my mind where I had a mix of OCD, ADHD and anxiety which resulted in extreme shyness and me inadvertently appearing rude because I had an uptight demeanour (as a coping mechanism)

I feel so despondent because I missed such a vital part of the growing up process (late adolescence) where most people had their first girlfriend, became more independent and seamlessly transitioned into adulthood. And high school where I am currently now forms the basis for most people's lifelong freindships. They were good people that wanted to be freinds with me, and they would be good for me. I wish I could go back in time and set my life on a different path.

If feels like if I let a guy know I'm interested in him I'm seen as too easy, too intense, or worse; I have been refered to as 'overlover' in the past. In fact I accidentally descovered it was a nick name I had gained in a community I was part of. There's defnintly worse labels. but it still hurt like a mofo.

Alternitively, if I keep it all hiden, I'm either viewed as not interested and plopped in the freind zone evermore, or that's when they start to draw me in, with best behaviour, only to push me away, with self serving, shitty behaviour, again when I respond positively. It definitly feels like being treated as a prize, and disguarded once won.

Am I honestly supposed to spend my life pretending not to like someone, so I can have a relationship with them? Am I going to be rejected everytime I relax and show affection? or trigger behaviour that is disrespectful to me? do I have to suffer to show my love?

The last time I feel like I could love without this fear was 20 years ago. Since then I've had mountains of confirmation that this is how it is. I'm a grown ass woman, with a grown ass career I'm not sure it can take any more of this life alone. No f\*cking way am I getting a fur baby.

FWB hangouts ‚Äî preference on you or the girl initiating?,"I‚Äôm new to this FWB thing‚Äîwhat are the communication rules? I‚Äôve had fuck buddies where I don‚Äôt care initiating most of the time because it was just sex, but this guy and I actually hang out and enjoy each other‚Äôs company (he has said this multiple times). I‚Äôm trying to stay detached but I do like the guy and would be up for more if he were. Otherwise I‚Äôm chill with what it is, and am dating other guys right now too.

So ‚Äî do you guys prefer to instigate the hangouts/hookups, or does it matter if it‚Äôs the girl most of the time? I have a high libido so it‚Äôs tough for me to wait for him to initiate, but it‚Äôs good sex and good company, so I also don‚Äôt want to be too needy/pushy and ruin a good thing.

How can I [22F] make myself more attractive?,"I'm 22F and I've recently found myself with a good 8 month break before I start grad school and since I finally have time, I want to dedicate myself to building healthy habits and working on my fitness. I was a runner back in high school but I've only been running maybe 1-2 miles 2-3x a week as of late. I've decided I want to pursue either training for a half marathon (would be in August giving me 8 months prep time) or pursue losing fat and toning up my body to get it as close as I can to Instagram model level lol.

I've done a lot of research and apparently most people who train for half marathons/marathons stay the same weight or actually gain weight so I can't realistically do both. The half marathon would give me a more concrete goal for sure but I have always been insecure of my body. Here for the male opinion: would you prefer a pudgy-er woman who's really into running or a super fit and lean woman who is more aesthetically pleasing but not athletically accomplished?

What would you do if your girlfriend suddenly asked you to get rid of anything that came before her?,"I'm at a loss. Out of no where my girlfriend has become fed up with relics of the past that she seems to think I have an emotional attachment to. I don't, they're practical things such as Halloween decorations (which I'm ready to trash), game consoles, and t-shirts of things I'm interested in. 

I'm willing to get rid of everything on a case by case basis in case she has assumed something was bought for me falsely. For the most part I enjoy these things outside of any relationship and I would go out and buy them again if I didn't have them. I want things to work but she's asking me to throw a lot of things out saying that I'm clinging to the past but won't say what it is she despises so much, rather I ought to know.

How easily do you relate to other men's emotions?,"I think women on a base level probably connect more with each others emotions, no matter the cause of them, like sad=sad. I was wondering if men do the same. I've been reading this subreddit a lot and I noticed a lot of the people relating and discussing emotions is very contextually based. I know it's easier to relate to each others emotions when there is context, like sad about being lonely=sad about being lonely (and that comments with emotional relatable context happens more frequently here because that's how people use reddit). But do you find, in general, that you NEED context to relate to other men's emotions? In real life, can you relate to other men's base emotions? 

I think women do, and it's that shared emotional ""sameness"" that helps women connect and form relationships easier. ",AskMen,1545378670,SoftCoyote,19,1,True,2018-12-20

What's the best way to get a man to open up about his feelings with you?,"In light of recent posts, I was wondering what I can do to show my guy friends (I'm in my university's physics club, so most of my friends are guys) that they can talk about feelings and admit to being stressed/sad/struggling with mental health. With one of them who is particularly resistant to feeling emotions on any level, I've tried to explicitly say that it's okay to feel negative emotions and to let them show, and that if he ever wants to talk I'll be there, but he's incredibly resistant to that. However, later on he got really drunk and started talking about what the best age to commit suicide at is, so I'm slightly concerned now (especially because he mentioned late 20s, after we'll have graduated and gone our separate ways).

I know I can't force any of them to open up, but it concerns me how hesitant guys are to talk about this stuff, and if there's anything I can do to help I want to. Because suffering alone sucks.",AskMen,1544070352,Im_a_sweet_potato,1,1,True,2018-12-05

In school for the trades. What to expect?,"I'm having a hard time finding trade-focused subreddits that are populated enough to give more than 3-4 responses, so I'm trying here since a search yielded lots of trades posts.  I apologize if I'm breaking any rules.

I'm currently in school for the automotive field (getting gen-studies out of the way first) but I'm a little dubious as to how ""blind"" I'm allowed to be going into it, but I chose this field because I genuinely believe I will enjoy it.  So, my questions:

1: **Should I try and ""pre-learn"" more about automotive stuff before my classes start?** I have a general understanding of how it all works, but I did not have the opportunity to grow up learning how to do this stuff; it feels like everyone I know who does this had a background of ""helping Dad fix cars in the garage"" and I'm wondering how much I'm lacking by not having that.

2: **Level of impact on physical health?** I already have some issues with my knees and ankles, but I may not necessarily be in this field until retirement age.  How much damage do I have to be careful of in this field? Any unexpected damage to be careful of to lungs/throat? Tips for avoiding it?

3: **How to not look like a colossal idiot?** See ""did not grow up learning this stuff""; I know the point in school is to learn, but still.

4: **Is it worth socializing?** I don't like talking much, but I wonder if I might miss out on career opportunities if I'm too quiet.

How does one gracefully back out of a date?,"So I am 19/F and in college. I go to school in a major city and my sorority is having our semi formal this weekend.

I wasn‚Äôt originally going to go, and then my sorority sister asked me if I would please go with her boyfriend‚Äôs best friend because he really wanted to go but didn‚Äôt have a date. She wanted to do like a double date situation with her and her bf and me and her bf‚Äôs best friend. 

I tried to say not at first but got talked into it and agreed to go. i‚Äôve never met or spoken to this boy who I am supposed to be going out with this weekend, I only know his first name, what he looks like, and that he‚Äôs 2 years older than me.

I was hanging out with a bunch of older girls in my sorority tonight and I told them about it and they all simultaneously and unanimously told me not to go out with him, that he has a reputation for making girls think he likes them and then just sleeping with them and blocking them on everything afterwards. 

He apparently has done this to multiple other girls in my sorority. They told me not to go near him with a ten foot pole. I am supposed to be going out with him Saturday. I think I‚Äôve decided to cancel on him, but I don‚Äôt know if I should wait until the day of and just say I am sick and cancel or if I should cancel now so he can make other plans for his Saturday night, I didn‚Äôt really date in high school and I‚Äôve never been in this predicament before. 

I also do not want my friend who set me up with him to be mad at me, and I don‚Äôt want to get a negative reputation with the frat he‚Äôs in for canceling on him so I need to do it really gracefully and in a way that leaves nobody upset or annoyed. 

TL;DR:Sorority sister set me up on a blind double date with her BF‚Äôs best friend, and then multiple other sorority sisters told me he‚Äôs mean to girls and is notorious for ghosting people. I really do not want to go out with him anymore and I don‚Äôt know how to cancel a date without causing any annoyance to either him r my friend who set me up with him.

How to avoid intimidating women in public areas?,"As a disclaimer, I'm not talking about approaching women or being seedy or doing anything intentional to draw a woman's attention in any way. I mean going about day to day life, walking around behind a woman, being in an elevator alone with one, etcetera. There's no issue in a group or in a controlled setting like in a shop, obviously.

But when walking behind a woman, for example, I make a very conscious effort to look to the side the entire time such that when she inevitably glances back furtively she knows I'm not eyeing her ass down. Or I walk past her loudly, while still facing away. And when in an elevator I try not to make eye contact and face away, or say a warm greeting to break the atmosphere. I've never had any real issue but women always seem suspicious, particularly as I'm not a small dude, and it's just uncomfortable and kind of draining to always be on high alert to avoid freaking or creeping out women.

How do I talk to my dad about his depression?,"Some backstory: I have been deeply depressed for the better part of this year. I‚Äôm currently a sophomore in college and have had a terrible time this semester trying to stay afloat because of a lot of suicidal thoughts. I finally disclosed this to my parents because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and they have been really supportive.

On to the question. About a month after I told them this was going on I overheard my dad talking to his brother in law about how deeply depressed he was and it made me feel terrible in a lot of ways. I don‚Äôt want my dad to have to feel the way I do because it‚Äôs a terrible feeling but at the same time I don‚Äôt want him to feel that way because I felt like I was depending on him for support. I don‚Äôt think he has been coping well and I hate that he feels this way and I am worried that this has been a glimpse of what my future will be like. I am pretty close with him but I‚Äôve never really talked to him about any of his serious issues. I knew he was lonely from working at home every day while my mom is teaching but I didn‚Äôt know he had crippling depression like me. What do I do?

"What does it feel like to ""shoot"" cum?","I did a quick search under ""ejaculation"" and I couldn't find anything that was quite what I'm asking, so I apologise if this has been asked before! 

Ever since I learned in health class that men ejaculate when they orgasm, I've been totally fascinated. My teacher said it was just a teaspoon that would dribble out, but my sexual experiences over the years (and video evidence, haha) have proven that some guys really do shoot, quite forcefully and copiously! There's nothing quite like feeling it shoot inside or on you, but I've always been so curious about what it must feel like for the man. Does it feel like peeing, like that relief when you really have to go and you finally let it go? Or like something else, since it's so much more viscous and intermittent instead of one long stream? I know how semen is produced, I know the muscles involved in ejaculation, I just don't know about the qualitative, subjective experience of actually shooting cum. It must feel so good! I'm so jealous honestly, haha.

How do you deal with a boss who does what his female employees him tell him to do and he obeys to avoid looking bad?,"I'm trying to understand if it's time to leave this job or if it's worth staying.

I'm spying on a few computers in the office (an ex coworker bugged them) which gives me full access to company's restricted information (numbers, contracts, etc) as well as the flow of information among coworkers (chit chat, who's doing what, who's offloading, etc). We are small and not in the US, so it's pretty much the wild west on certain things here.

I have two bosses, both owners of the company (50-50). Partner A is a work-horse, responsible for 80% of the income, while Partner B is.. enjoying the money, the decision making, but doesn't work.

One of the computers I'm monitoring belongs to a woman coworker of mine who Partner A is in love with. He has a wife, children, etc, but of course, he would like to nail her. This guy talks to her every fucking day like if he was a woman: before meetings, after meetings, they send each other vocal messages while driving, etc.

He tried to fuck her 2 years ago and she shut him down quick, so the only thing he gets out of this is trying to seduce her by being her ‚Äúprotector‚Äù. He also complains about his business partner all the time to her, as well as certain employees, and of course, the woman is hell bent on fucking over those she doesn't like..

Now here's the kick: Partner A is very passive, so I don't really understand if the true ""him"" is the one who vents to this woman in private or the one who's actually afraid of pissing anyone off, employees included.

The woman he's in love with, in turn, acts behind people's back telling other what to do, even among coworkers, undermining you and even insulting you if she deems it necessary.

Today I told one of the women I work with to talk to Partner B (the guy that cannot be manipulated) because she was needed somewhere else, just for today. She was terrified of talking to him because she was doing a job for him, but I didn't give two shits about her, all she had to do was ask.

She talked to him, but also complained to the other woman, who in turn immediately informed Partner A of the situation *and* tried to stop my coworker from talking to the other boss. In the mean time, I got a few insults. 

When Partner A came into the office, my coworker ""warned"" him about the fact ""he had to talk to the other owner"" (he was already informed by the other woman), and he immediately agreed with her and told her  ""she was safe"" and that ""Kacey (me) was wrong and had to talk to the other partner himself or talk to him so that he could talk to the other partner..."". Fyi, I'm not management here, just an employee.

Essentially, Partner A and his muse didn't like that I put her in a position of talking to Partner B, as they try to shield her from the guy. You know, adults...

8 hours later, Parnter A comes into my office and ""casually"" asks me (the girl was gone for the day) how the assignment my coworker did went. He never, ever fucking asks stuff like that. He came in because he needed to know the girl was safe. I told him she finished the tasks so everything was cool. I also added, casually, that I'd asked Partner B if she could do this, as well as told her to do the same, and Partner A's reply was shaking his head, dismissing what I was saying, and saying ""I'm not interested in that"".

Everything's like this. Every little shit gets blown out of proportion behind our backs by either one or the other female, and my boss listens to them. And the one he's in love with is totally out of control, fucking trying to interfere on shit she has nothing to do with. However, when it's time to drop the hammer, Partner A doesn't do it.

My point is... is this dangerous professionally, long term? Do men like this eventually screw you over in order to make women like these ""happy"", or is just an act to endear himself to them?",AskMen,1542782380,stephen_rex,4,1,True,2018-11-20

Wishing him happy birthday?,"We were dating for 4 months, hit it off unexpectedly well, and just clicked. Saw each other 1-2x a week, usually for 6+ hour dates. He broke up with me because work life and family happenings were stressing him out and he didn't have time for anything serious. Got the usual platitudes of being an amazing girl, just the wrong timing.

His birthday is in a week. I know he dismissed me and likely doesn't want to hear from me, and I'm answering my own question here, basically.

What have we done to you?  How could we cruelly butcher your sex?  How is it okay to do this to humans?  This is done with little thought of the devastation it causes to the infant.  

How can we expect anything less than sexual dysfunction from the very violent way we blunt, and mame you, just because of the organ between your legs?
I'm so so sorry this was done to you.  I weep for the NEEDLESS suffering thrust upon you.  Especially because it's done in complete ignorance to the actual horror thrust upon you.

Can I slide in his DM‚Äôs again?,"Hey, so, like, just here to ask the most stupid and dramatic question of my life because I don‚Äôt date and I‚Äôve never done this whole dm‚Äôing thing and I overthink everything :‚Äô)

[DM SCREENSHOT](https://imgur.com/gallery/k7koElW) 

Looking back on our last couple messages I‚Äôm seeing that I might‚Äôve sounded short or cold? So what do you think? Could that be why he didn‚Äôt respond or could he possibly think I‚Äôm the one who wasn‚Äôt interested/losing interest? Lol. I‚Äôll attach a screenshot of our final messages to show you what I mean. All prior messages were more impressive than these and were pretty equal in the asking questions department.
(LOL, don‚Äôt judge him for saying ‚Äúlit‚Äù üò©... I already did enough in my head.)

Would it be desperate if I initiated conversation again? Like ‚ÄúHey! How are you settling in to Chicago?‚Äù or something? 

~a lil background~

hesitantly ‚Äúslid into the dm‚Äôs‚Äù of my gym crush a couple weeks ago because I found out last minute (through a family member who knows his Mother lolol only reason I even found out his name/a bit about him) that he actually moved to Chicago for a while and I was going back to where I live too so I knew chances of ever seeing him again were slim and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him so I just bit the bullet lol. We talked 24 hours straight (with decent breaks in between, though) and then nothing since. I suppose the conversation had come to the standstill/ending point, but at the same time there was definitely still room for more questions/convo to be made. I had actually thought of not replying to what he said so that I wouldn‚Äôt be the one who didn‚Äôt get a reply, BUT IM JUST NOT THAT PERSON so I just said some random remark back and he didn‚Äôt respond. It‚Äôs been two weeks now. Our conversation was almost equal in the question asking/taking interest in one another, but I‚Äôm the one who said/typed more so by the end I was feeling like maybe I was saying too much so I shortened my answers.

The way I see it is that if he was interested he would‚Äôve responded or at least tried to make conversation. He watches all my IG stories (omg, this sounds so millennial, it hurts) and we have a lot in common as far as interests and music tastes go, so he could‚Äôve replied to any of that. He just moved to a new city and is probably focused on settling in. Also, maybe he thinks it‚Äôs useless to get to know me since we both live different places? Idk. But I‚Äôve made plenty friends online and have traveled to visit them and them to me, it‚Äôs been some of the most enriching experiences of my life so I‚Äôm totally open to going to meet him if we click.
On the flip side, I think there‚Äôs a small chance he might think he‚Äôs not ‚Äúlike‚Äù me/good enough, etc which makes me wanna reach out to him more bc I definitely don‚Äôt think that. (Don‚Äôt ask how I came to this conclusion. Has to do with where we grew up and their mentality/how I turned out lol.)


I think he‚Äôs a cool guy and I‚Äôd really like to get to know him as a friend more.. For all I know I could get to know him more and realize we could never date, and same goes for him. But I‚Äôm so hesitant on whether messaging him again is okay. Especially on DM‚Äôs. I‚Äôd much rather have his number to text or even speak on the phone, but again, no idea how to approach that. 

What should I dooooo? Ha. So lame.

 I usually say something along the lines of, that's kind of out of my budget if you don't mind going somewhere more casual. But that can be awkward, esp. since the guy has usually already made reservations at the restaurant or whatever. How should I handle this?

"Where are some good places, or good methods, for a socially inept guy to meet girls while attempting to fake-it-til-you-make-it?","Here's a short summary of me and what I'm looking for exactly:

-I'm 21

-Haven't had a friend and I've probably left my house for social outings (including family related) in a grand total of 4 years. Maybe more like 6 if you include high-school.

-I was born with a speech defect. I don't talk quite like a normal person. I don't really feel self conscious about it, I've had 21 years to cope with it. But keep that in mind when thinking of places for me to go. I don't want to be the freak at a bar everyone doesn't like.

-I have ~$20,000 saved up. I'm extremely cheap in most cases, obviously how I got that money. But I love to blow it. Best example (and probably one of the best experiences I had as of late) going to red lobster by myself shortly after my 21st birthday, getting drunk, and trying to eat this stupid fucking lobster. Couldn't open it. Asked the waiter for help. She couldn't. Had a little fun. I have no problem spending money on expensive outings, or doing this a shit load and accumulating a lot of bills. As long as it's not casino or strip club spending levels.

-I have a large number of hobbies, yet I'm a master of none. I like mountain biking. Went skydiving a few weeks ago (alone). I like fishing. I played baseball for 11 years, football for 8, soccer for 3, I love playing but I hate watching. I like to cook, but have trouble doing it when there's no one around to motivate me or to share it with. I like to woodwork, but I fucking suck and screw it up a lot. I made a bird house about a year ago. Birds moved in! 

-I work 10 hour days. I wake up 15 minutes before I have to leave for work, 7AM. I get home at about 7AM. I go to sleep at 10-11PM. So yea, not a whole lot of room to work with. But I worked 2 jobs in the past for quite awhile. It's not really an issue for me to be out and pushing my limits. 

-As I recently turned 21, I just drink and play rocket league mostly now. I can feel myself slipping down this slope and I know where it leads. Instead of sulking over the last ~half decade of depression and loneliness, I want to just not be this before it's too late.

**Where should I go to meet women?**

Might sound like a stupid question. I searched the question. Only 1 relevant question came up, 4 years old. Hoping for maybe new answers and something tailored to me a bit more.

Is this literally as simple as making small talk with random people in public? I've done that before, not trying to meet up. I don't really know how to push that towards, ""hey let's go on a date"". What are some good suggestions for this method? How do I find a possible person? Anyone? Is this just an odds scenario?

Is this a, ""go here, do this"" kind of thing? How does that work. I've gone to bars before. Always ends up with me ordering 3 drinks in 30 minutes and leaving. Not really many opportunities to meet women in my opinion. Maybe wrong location. I don't know.

Any other advice for faking it until you make it?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been trying to get into dating recently. I'd say I don't have too bad of approach anxiety or anything. But recently I've been approaching girls more often, and of course getting rejected more often. Last Friday, I went downtown to a club with a few friends and started approaching a lot of women, chatting, and asking them to dance. After about the 8th rejection I just gave up and felt terrible, like no girl would ever be interested in me. It's really effected my self esteem. I didn't think I was that ugly, but now after I've been rejected by like 15 girls in a row I feel terrible.

&amp;#x200B;

Definitely not a good coping strategy, but after all those rejections, I installed Tinder and set up a date this Friday with a girl I'm not even super attracted to. I just wanted to see if any girl would actually say yes. She did, but it didn't help me feel any better.

How do I stop caring whether or not people know how intelligent I am?,"Ok let me get this out of the way first. There seems to be a stigma on Reddit where anyone who claims to be ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô explicitly isn‚Äôt. This is not a thread to debate the reasons why I know this to be the case. So if you can‚Äôt get past the question, don‚Äôt bother answering.

So to make a long story short, I‚Äôve been having issues with depression. I‚Äôm seeing a therapist, and it is exposing a lot of my issues that are causing this, but some things she won‚Äôt be able to tell me how to solve. The issue here is this: my only great quality (I.e reason people would want to be around me) is my intelligence, which is something that isn‚Äôt visible like height or easy to notice like a social personality. This leads me to almost force the conversation into places where it would be obvious (nowhere near comparable to r/iamverysmart level but still enough to be awkward), or interrupt people because if I don‚Äôt get a chance to contribute an idea to a conversation people will question my understanding of the topic. If those were the only things I did, it would just be a simple matter of just fixing them, but I know there‚Äôs probably more that I don‚Äôt know about. So I have to fix the root of the problem. I‚Äôm working on getting other qualities that people would want to know me for, but I‚Äôm far enough into those that I can say having them won‚Äôt fix the problem. So that leads me to my question: Aside from acquiring new qualities as a person (hobbies, personality changes, etc.) how do I not care what people think about my intelligence?",AskMen,1541483902,Dudeman1000,25,1,True,2018-11-05

Why do tears run through my eyes when in a tense situation and how do I stop it from happening?,"Ever since I was little, whenever I was any tense, or even not-so-tense situation, I would have tears in my eyes.

In school, if I was being told off by the teacher, I would feel like I was about to cry. Didn't do the homework and being questioned as to why I didn't do it? Tears. My work not up to par? Tears. Family annoyed at me for x,y,z? Tears. In an argument/fight with someone? Tears again...

Obviously, as a male, or even as a person in general, I don't like this happening to me. The thing is, for a lot of the things that happen, I don't really care about it anywhere near enough to cry. For example, when my teachers were questioning me about why I didn't do my homework. I didn't do it because I didn't want to do it, because I was lazy. I wasn't worried about anything, In my head I just wanted to shrug it off, but for some reason, even though I knew I 100% didn't care, I almost cried. To cry over a couple of these scenarios, sure, fair enough. But to cry over countless things, whenever I'm in any situation that is not relaxed, it's uncomfortable for me to think about, and \*very\* uncomfortable for me in the moment.

Advice: Eye contact games/bashful guy,"So there is a guy at my gym I really like.  He's confident, about 15-20 years older than me (I'm 34), very in shape, and all the young guys ask him for advice on how to get as big as he is.  He's kinda the hot, older, patriarch/alpha guy.  It all started with him noticing me after I had dropped 30 pounds after months and months of working out.   I had noticed him months before, but I was big enough of a girl that I don't think I had been on his radar.  He gave me the up down, full body glance and made sure I saw him do it.  I tried not to read too much into it but I was flattered, guys like him never looked at me before I lost weight.  A few days go by and I'm in dance class near the window.  He stops to stretch outside at the stretching area.  I catch him watching me, he doesn't hide it.  We play this eye contact game for a few weeks and I finally get up the courage to talk to him.  Just introduce myself and ask him his name.  He is all smiley and it is brief but pleasant.  I talk to him over the next few days just saying hi, he's still playing the eye contact games.  Then boom.  Next two times I attempt to say hi he completely ignores me and begins avoiding me for 2 months.  He occasionally would still sneak glances at me but he'd literally walk to the other side of the gym if I was there and he saw me.  Like he was terrified of me.  After two months of ignoring me, he starts peeking at me in dance class again and begins the full out eye contact game he had been doing before.  Intentionally working out next to me instead of avoiding me.  However if I try to approach him, his confident behavior crumbles and he gets so nervous.  I don't know what I am doing wrong or if I just unnerve him because I'm younger, or maybe he's married.  I don't know anything about him other than his first name.  But it's obvious we are attracted to each other.  I don't understand how he's so confident with anyone and everyone else but so bashful with me.  I'm kind of scared to try talking to him again since last time it seemed to push him away.  Should I wait for him to approach me this time?  Maybe he never will because he's married?

What should I do about my friends actions?,"(fyi this is a throwaway account for anonymity sake)

Hope you are all well, thanks for taking the time to weigh in and read.

I was at a party at a friends place, wasn't too big, a mellow and mature gathering. Another friend of ours invited a girl over who he had been apparently hooking up with. None of us had heard of her or met her before, so it was a casual and recent thing. She shows up and is already pretty drunk and starts to cause a bit of commotion. People were playing board games and she wanted to party and she was basically being loud, obnoxious and disrepectful to the vibes in the room. She eventually settled down but was still a drunk mess, she was stumbling and falling over on the floor and being a goofy drunk girl. She eventually managed to settle down on the couch and my buddy who invited her over poured a large glass of wine and hands it over to her. Seemed odd to me since she was already wasted, he didn't take a sip or anything and it was a a heaping glass. He was really drunk and I was to the side watching this all go down while having a pleasant conversation with someone I met.

Moments later my buddy who is a big tough athletic dude and the girl head off to a bedroom (my others friends room) and close the door. I forget about them and then later learn they both left. Soon after the party wraps up and we leave and we find my buddy outside sitting on the curb alone. He's none too pleased and tells us that the girl literally ran away from the party.

I'm sober at this point and he is way drunk but basically he says that they fooled around a bit and then decided to go back to his apartment but the moment they got to the front door of the house she ran away from him and he couldn't keep up and she ran back to her place without him.

I told him rejection sucks and we went our separate ways, he got a cab home and I chose to take the bus, but I'm starting to wonder, is this suspect? Why would she run away like that?

I've no idea who the girl is or what her name is, I hope she's okay but I dunno. What do you all think? What should I do? My buddy seems to act as if all is normal but we've not seen this girl since and the whole situation just leaves a bad taste in my mouth",AskMen,1540178603,JeffPNW,0,1,True,2018-10-21

"Am I (F,20) coming off as convenient or the designated text when intoxicated friend ? How to let him (M,21) know , I‚Äôm not that cool with it ?","This guy in one of my university classes asked for my number, it went from texting about school work to more casual stuff. when we do talk he replies fairly fast but then doesn't message me again until we have class the next week or the weekend  or if he's intoxicated. I'm not even sure if we're friends, I mean I can tell he's attracted to me but that's it , which is fine with me since i'm not sure how to feel about him.  The past few times we texted he was intoxicated again, I guess I'm a little naive but I get a little worried even if I don't mention it so I reply/keep the convo going but i'm starting to think he only wants to talk when he's like that, and I don't like that he continues the text convo even if it's a week old  like nothing happened. Since i'm the one replying , my message is also the last one until he replies when he's next intoxicated, I think I might have given him the wrong signals. Like i'm convenient so he doesn't need to put any effort in but i'm just being nice (out of worry) , I don't know if he'll message me again but I'll be seeing him in class . I'm not sure what to say to him that'll make him realize that although I don't mind talking I don't want him only texting me when he's intoxicated or starting a conversation only to reply late, I have a busy life I just don't trust intoxicated friends to make smart choices so I try to be there when they message me when they're like that.

Not sure how to bring up possible HPV with partner,"Earlier this year I had a couple tiny painless bumps appear (and disappear about 1 month later), in my pubic area. My doctor said possible ingrown hair follicles or possible HPV related, but that there was no way to tell for sure.  I told myself that I would tell all partners about this because the whole situation was so stressful, even if I‚Äôm not sure it was HPV (especially since that time frame for the bumps isn‚Äôt totally consistent with it) and that I would do so in a way that would give them a chance to think about it when we aren‚Äôt drunk or in a heat-of-the-moment type situation. 

I went on a first date with a girl that went really well, and we ended up in bed together and things got a little unexpectedly hot and heavy. I got pretty anxious about how I was going to bring it up, and that thought prevented me from being able to get hard, so nothing ended up happening and I wasn‚Äôt forced to bring it up then.  At one point she asked if I had a condom, and I did look through my wallet. Had things been working, I would‚Äôve brought it up, but at the time I felt like it gave me an (albeit awkward) out to be able to bring up later.  Now, I‚Äôm afraid that when I do bring it up, it could seem like I wasn‚Äôt planning on telling her then, especially since I looked for a condom.  We‚Äôve been texting back and forth almost constantly since then, but haven‚Äôt seen each other again yet.

Guys I need your advice!! Is he falling for me?,"**Background**\- In December 2017 I met this guy(25yo). We both worked for the same company abroad. He's from England. I'm from the US(Im 24yo). I have been living there for 2 years. We started talking lightly, then in January we became FWBs real quick. we talked every day, etc. At the end of March He ended our FWB relationship and decided to just become friends. Our texting got lighter to each other and came in waves of him texting me. One week it would be every day. The next would be every couple days. We later had an unplanned hook up in late April. Thats was the last time we hooked up. We then texted every day but as friends. He left were we lived end of may. He then went traveling with his friend from home. I left in June to go traveling. we ended up traveling together for like 3 weeks. I met his friend from home, got a feeling he wasn't told we use to be FWBs, was constantly teased for flirting with each other and having sexual tension. Became really good friends with my friend. We both went back to our homes (him- england, Me-USA) in August. We talk every couple weeks to catch up with each other.¬†  


**Situation-**¬†We were in a normal conversation and made a few back and forth banter. Then something odd happened. He randomly said¬†‚Äúyou know I was thinking, and this just shows how cool you are, you know the most about me, ya know. With my friends it‚Äôs all banter I never get serious and your the only one I ever did with‚Äù... I was completely thrown off. I thought "" well this is the moment he confesses his love for me"".. We talked a few messages about it and then he completely switched. He then went off about how he wants to hook up with some girl and how he has these girl problems. Im very confused on what happened? He went from being serious to being a ""player"". I see him in 3 weeks and I don't know if I should ask him about it. I like him, I never get jealous or anything.

"What is the best way to handle a situation with a girl whom you once shared an intimate but never serious relationship with, but are interested in one now?","So, I met this girl who was visiting her friend at my college during homecoming week Sophomore year and we hit it off. She was the first girl I ever got really intimate with, so our experiences were pretty memorable to me. When she returned back to her college that weekend, I told her I would hit her up when I was on break because she lived within an hour of my house and she agreed.

We hung out and continued to be intimate during that Thanksgiving break and Winter break. Never once did we talk about ""us"" or any relationship possibility because we were both pretty inexperienced at the time and didn't know how to really talk about those kinds of things. 

When I look back at it now, there were a lot of signs pointing that a relationship is something she might've been interested in. She talked to me about her family, pets, allowed me to stay over, didn't want me to leave the next day, etc. However, I was entering my Junior year of college and had no intentions of being in a long distance relationship while I was in school for obvious reasons. 

During the summer after my Junior year was over, I sent her a good-sized text asking if she was interested in hanging out again like we were doing before. This time she replied no though. I'm pretty sure the reason was because she felt like we were ""using"" each other to cancel out the loneliness we both were feeling. She actually mentioned this before when we were together, but being the idiot I was, I had no idea what she was getting at. 

So here I am today, graduated college, full-time job, feeling great about my physical/mental health and this girl is still on my mind. I haven't been with a girl and had the intimate experiences that I had with this girl since I was last with her and I want that to happen again. I got so intrigued thinking about her one night, that I actually tried to add her on snap again which she never accepted, which is probably not good for my credibility lol.

 I currently work in a big city and she attends a university in the same city so we are close to each other location wise and there is no long distance factor involved like before. I really believe that we really had potential for something if there wasn't a distance factor involved a couple years ago and I wasn't in college.

This leads me to my question: Should I hit her up casually asking her to catch up for coffee or something or is that the wrong approach. Should I even hit her up at all or will I come off as creepy? 

I feel like if I hit her up and get a definitive answer, I'll stop thinking about her and will be able to move on or not (depending on her response). What do you all think though?",AskMen,1540188040,JusJewIt,9,1,True,2018-10-21
What Should I Do About This Girl?,"So there's this girl, ""K"".

We just started college a few weeks ago; we did a pre-orientation trip before we began that was essentially a week-long camping experience in the woods. We didn't talk much-in fact, I sorta developed a crush on this other girl in the group (2 counselors, 12 campers) because she payed attention to me, listened to my stupid stories and was suuuuuper smart and engaging. 

Then the school year started.

Our orientation group formed a sort of semi-cohesive ""unit"", however about half of them ended up leaving to form their own groups, leaving just me, my guy friend L, my guy friend A, the girl I had a crush on during the trip I'll call ""J"", another girl on the trip ""E"", and this other girl ""K"". 

I soon realized I was just infatuated with ""J"" because she was the first person I really got to know well at my school (a lot of really smart people go here, I just got in because I'm brown and I'm poor). By this time however, I had told my 2 guys friends, ""L"" and ""A"", as well as ""K"". They knew I had a crush, but then I told them I had gotten over it. Fine.

That's when my stupid, STUPID loser lizard brain started working it's magic.

(I think I might be in the midst of a serious bout of depression, and have been so stressed about a lot of stuff right now that I'm scared by frequent thoughts of suicide. I think this state of mind have made me even more of a leech than usual, which I think has contributed to my situation.) 

Ever so slightly, I began to really like this girl, ""K"".

It started slowly--we talked a bit, hung out, went to a few parties (I really suck at those though). Then I began to realize all the little things she did that made me happy/life easier. 

I didn't know how to ride a bike until recently, so I kind of ran everywhere. 

She walked her bike next to me. Even though she never had to, she'd get off her bike and walk next to me. I asked her one time why she did this-she said it made talking longer.
She always makes sure I'm engaged in conversations, especially ones where I'm the odd one out with strangers she knows but I don't. We stayed up until 2-3 in the morning a few times, just talking about life, family, cool junk and fun stuff. She takes quick glances towards me every so often to check me out, make sure I'm still ""with it"". 

I can feel her caring about me, and it makes....me....feel.....loved.......

She had one of the most beautiful smiles I've ever seen. Every time I'm with her, I try to do or say as many stupid or funny things as possible just so I can see her smile or laugh. Every single time I see her toothy grin, it's as if all my worries disappear, if only for a moment. I can literally feel my heat flutter when she's nearby.

I love talking to her. She smart-INCREDIBLY SMART- quick witted, introspective, and thoughtful. Talking with her is like speaking to the sea-amazing in scope, captivating it her beauty, and unfathomably deep in her character. 

She
IS
WAAAAAAY
OUT
OF
MY 
LEAGUE.

She's also getting over her last boyfriend. They were together for quite a while, and she seems to miss him greatly.
This is makes me uncomfortable for 2 reasons;

A-because she's my friend and I want her to be happy, but also really like her and feel bad about not being as good-looking or smooth as he appeared to have been 
and 
B- because I'm her friend, I feel like taking advantage of our closeness whenever she's vulnerable around me and the group.

I feel like a closet asshole, like the kind of douchebag that preys upon the emotionally wounded in order to score.

It makes me hate myself.

But I still want her to be happy.

She said she needed to get over her boyfriend by spending some time with other people. I thought that was a great idea, and along with the rest of our friend group encouraged her to get back out there and live a little. 

My friends convinced me to ask her out to a school formal, so I got really excited and had my prom suit shipped so I could look nice when I asked her out (I never used it again because my prom date got asked by another, betterlooking guy a week before prom and she said yes/dumped me). I was super hyped-I had it all figured out. I was going to ask her to go eat ice cream, then we'd head back to her dorm and do HW for a bit, then as it got real late and we ditched our hw, I'd ask her in a moment of sleep-induced lucid courage.

The she met this guy, ""G"", and they made out a bit.

I found out and cried for, like, 2 hours.

I
DON'T
KNOW
WHY
I
FEEL
LIKE
THIS.

She has every right to meet other people. I'm not one of those incel creeps who thinks women should cater to every man's needs, it's just that it feels so shitty not telling her about how I feel and being in such close proximity to her every time she tells us about how her relationships are doing. I haven't told her how I feel yet because I know she's in a weird spot emotionally because of her ex. I'm also a massive pussy.

My friends, ""A"" and ""L"" have been very supportive of me. They encourage the crap out of me, and reassured me over and over that I do have a chance if I ask her out. I don't know. I feel pretty gross. I'm about a cm shorter than her, brown, not good-looking or particularly interesting, and poor af. I feel like if I ask her, she'll be grossed out by me.

I also feel like if I ask her out, it could make things weird between us, ruining this friend circle we've made. I'm really, REALLY going through a tough time right now, and I don't think I have the willpower to not have a breakdown alone. Plus, she's still feeling bad about her ex, and I don't want to hurt her. 

I just......she makes me feel happy. 

I'm so alone right now, I feel empty and sad and lonely, like, all the time except when I'm out with her and my friends. 

I want to be happy.

Please any and all advice would be helpful-should I ask her out? ",AskMen,1540188255,MarcoMarco54321,0,1,True,2018-10-21

Predicament about how to bring up a possible HPV infection,"Earlier this year I had a few little painless bumps pop up in my pubic area. Doctor wasn‚Äôt sure what they were, but said it could be ingrown hairs or HPV related. They went away in about 1.5months, which isn‚Äôt totally consistent with HPV. This all stressed me out, so I promised myself I would tell any partners about it regardless of me being unsure whether I even had it (at least for the next year assuming no new symptoms, at which point the viral infection is considered cleared, and maybe longer/forever.)  I also decided I wouldn‚Äôt force someone to make the decision to possibly expose themselves to it when they‚Äôre drunk or in a heat-of-the-moment situation, because in either of those situations I would be liable to make a rash decision. 

So I matched with someone on bumble three weeks ago, and conversation steadily progressed until we went on a first date (hiking), which went very well and also somewhat unexpectedly ended up with us in bed together.  I got nervous about how I was going to bring it up, and because of that, my equipment wasn‚Äôt functional...while awkward for me, this did give me a little way out for the time being.  At one point during all this, she asked if I had a condom, and I searched through my wallet but didn‚Äôt have one.  

Basically, I was stupid and should have just brought it up then, and now I‚Äôm afraid that when I tell her, she will think that I was going to potentially expose her without telling her (especially since I looked for a condom).  We‚Äôve been texting constantly since then but haven‚Äôt had a chance to see each other again, and for my peace of mind I have to bring it up soon. 

Any suggestions for tactful ways to do this?

My girlfriend wants me to lie about my religion to her family. What do you think?,"She and I had a conversation about eventually meeting each other's families. We've been together one year so I predict it will happen very soon. We sort of briefed each other on how our respective families tick and how to best make a good impression on them. When the topic of religion came up she advised, implored really, that I tell them I am christian, which I am not.

I'm not someone who likes to lie, whether explicitly or implicitly. Whenever possible I do my best to tell the truth and avoid pretending to be things i'm not. Personally i'd rather be disliked for who i am than otherwise and, as i've expressed to her, I highly doubt her family would appreciate finding out i lied to them later me than telling the truth or at least not lying at all. I've brought up to her that alternative answers to questions like ""what's your religion?"" could be things along lines of ""I was raised christian"". However, she warns me that her family is not that simple or, frankly, respectful.

I'm very uncomfortable with lying to people, especially if those people may become important to me in the future. In addition, I fear where will a lie about a topic such as religion will lead (will they have me participate in religious practices with which i'm uncomfortable?) I'm conflicted on where the line should be drawn (if any at all). Is it better to be truthful, or at least not untruthful, and risk her family going out of their way to stand between my girlfriend and I (which she's strongly expressed is a possibility) or is it better to essentially start and build a relationship on a lie in order to be liked, possibly accepted, and safeguard my relationship but quite possibly be an issue in the future when the truth is discovered?",AskMen,1540200114,Armando_Munoz,298,1,True,2018-10-22

Whats the best way to find new female friends?,"Im 21 and  started to work improve my life and i wanted to gain new friends. Im sick of working 5 days,being 2 days alone and repeat that cycle.  

I have some male friends and its great, i like to do stuff with them and so on.  

But somehow i cant get in contact with females. Like hanging out with dudes or a mixed group is cool and so on but sometimes im missing something like a bestfriend ""female version"".  Like its calming doing something together,watch netflix,talk about life and problems and so on, without the intention of sex/love. Just like a regular friendship.

When hanging out with a mixed group the girl  are usually the girlfriend of another men there and it would be kinda weird building a good friendship with the girlfriend of a friend.   

 I tried Tinder and Lovoo (its like tinder just bigger in germany) and yea of course it did not work out. Most girls think i just want sex or a relationship. I can't really talk to random persons on the street and concerts/festivals are not really my thing. When i was really young (like 14) i used to watch anime and went to some conventions where i met a lot of new people. But most people are to young and im not into anime anymore.

Is there something like Tinder just for friends?

Would a cam girls disability put you off if you liked them? How can I market myself as more than my disabilities so that I'm not typecast?,"I used to be a cam girl and loved it.

If you found a cam girl that you liked the look of, would the tube turn you off? It's super small and thin and I often tuck the length of it in my bra just to make it a bit more subtle. 

It would break my heart if nobody saw me as attractive because of it. Hell, *I* don't see myself as attractive because of it (which is half the reason I want to do cam work again, because it really boosted my confidence). I don't want to only be attractive to fetishists, I want to be attractive to regular people too you know?

What are your thoughts of my situation?,"What do you all think? 

I posted this on the gay men sub because I thought they could have good advice, but would like advice from men here too since there could be more straight guys too. 

I‚Äôm a straight guy and have been my whole life, I‚Äôm 20 years old and have dated girls before and am currently talking to a girl I like. However, this past summer I stayed at my uni to take classes and work on other stuff. So, in my group there was a guy who I knew since the spring semester but he was always just there and just saw him as one of the rest. However, towards the end of the summer I ran into him at the airport because we were going back home and we sat together and talked for like 3 hours (with breaks in between of course). Then, when we were talking I said that I was going to the beach with a girl and he asked if this girl was something else. So this left me thinking that he might be into me. I always thought he was straight. 

DISCLAIMER: I don‚Äôt think that all gay guys are into any guy that has a pulse, I‚Äôm not homophobic. 

So then between that day and the day when school started (3 weeks or so), I kept thinking about him, not every day of course. 

Then, when uni started this semester, the summer program I was in, had a welcome party/get together and he was there as well as all the other students. When I saw him I didn‚Äôt feel anything but I was happy that I saw him again and asked him how things were and whatnot, then we basically spent the whole time together and when we were asking each other about things we did, he mentioned that he went somewhere with his boyfriend and I was shocked lol I said ‚Äúoh..‚Äù but then just kept talking. So I asked him about him being gay and what it‚Äôs like and all the questions people ask. Anyways, we had a great day and there were times where we made eye contact that scared me because it felt nice to look into each other‚Äôs eyes. 

Now ever since that party, I think about him at least once a day or 4-5 times a week. 

Every time we run into each other we talk and it feels ‚Äúmagical‚Äù lol. We smile a lot, lock eyes, and I feel like he‚Äôs flirting with me (flirting back? I feel like I‚Äôm flirting without wanting too, I‚Äôm very flirtatious). Sometimes when I think of him I get goosebumps (like when you‚Äôre a young teenager in love). 
I want to keep talking to him and get to know him more and hang out, but I don‚Äôt know if this is just me liking him as a friend or the other reason. 
However, like I said, he has a boyfriend so here are the problems/questions: 
1) I‚Äôm not gay. Is this just a man crush? Summer thing? 
2) Even if I was anything, I don‚Äôt see me dating him or anything. 
3) he has a boyfriend, why do I feel like he‚Äôs flirting back? 
4) Since he has a boyfriend, I‚Äôve been thinking that I should cut ties with him because if I were to actually like him, I‚Äôm meddling in between them and personally I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right, it goes against my morals. Also, if he were to like me, I don‚Äôt want to make him like me even more and then cause problems in his relationship. 
5) since I don‚Äôt see me dating him or being gay, I don‚Äôt want him to break up with his boyfriend and think that we could be boyfriends (I‚Äôm not trying to sound cocky, but you never know).
6) I‚Äôm confused, help.
7) I probably have more questions and there are other problems but this post is already too messy. 

Thank you for reading and am sorry for all the grammatical errors, but I‚Äôve been wanting to tell ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù about this, but I don‚Äôt have anyone since I don‚Äôt want people to think I‚Äôm gay or bisexual just for something that might just be insignificant or temporary. Also, funny enough the other day I watched Alex StrangeLove because it popped up first on the list of movies of Netflix and I kinda related to how Alex felt. 

Thanks again.

EDIT: I don‚Äôt consider myself friends with this guy. We are more like acquaintances/good classmates, but we don‚Äôt hang out (I kinda want to) or have each other‚Äôs social media, etc, all the friends stuff. Also, I‚Äôve been single for a year or so and am talking to this girl just now, so could it be that I just feel some type of lonely? 
Finally, before posting this, I had already decided that I will stop having those long conversations I have with him every time I see him or be as smiley, but then I kept thinking about him so I decided to post and vent. Thanks for all the help. 

EDIT 2: I‚Äôm on my last year of Uni and I‚Äôve never done crazy things and lately I have made friends with people that are very open minded and at one point, the possibility of ‚Äútrying something new‚Äù flew by my mind. 

EDIT 3: at one point, I actually thought that I could give this a try and was thinking of asking him to hang out or eat something, but then I didn‚Äôt do it because he has a boyfriend so it‚Äôd be shitty from me to ask him to chill if I know my intentions are not clear.

Then to top it off I went straight to his house after I got back. We fucked and he fell asleep after and told me I‚Äôm going to sleep. He ignored the present I got him despite me telling him how excited I was to give him this gift. He never even said thanks. 

Moreover he would constantly be on Instagram while ignoring me. I was trying to be fun and cute with him and he ignored it. He would give me one word responses at times and seemed to ignore what I said about myself and instead only answered the question I had about him. 

I told him yesterday at work this isn‚Äôt working for me anymore. He freaks and blows up my phone. Is super pissed he told me this over text at work and sent me like fifteen messages in a row. I told him he was distant and I tried really hard and it didn‚Äôt seem he cared. He said really, if I didn‚Äôt care I wouldn‚Äôt be blowing up your phone and ‚Äúreally, I open up to you and make you my gf and you do this to me?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been needy in the past so I stopped doing that cause it ruined relationships‚Äù 

I felt bad about how I addressed it and apologized and agreed to talk to him in person about it. Since then he has left me on read for the entire day. 

I have a history of liking narcissistic men. I am curious if I should be worried? I feel terrible about how I addressed it but I felt so shitty and horrible that I tried so hard for someone who could seem to not care less. ",AskMen,1538893620,Jessiejessie34,29,1,True,2018-10-06

How can I stop getting strung along by the men I date?,"F, early 20's.   


Throughout the years, every guy I've dated or liked has strung me along. It's like a cycle...   


1. Befriend guy  

2. Flirt  

3. Go out  

4. Date for a few months  

5. He becomes distant for days/weeks/months. I ask if he's ok.  

6. I get dumped, ghosted or am basically forced to dump him  


Every relationship I've had has turned out this way. For a while, I thought it was the type of guys I was dating but since then, I've broadened my horizons. I'm still having the same problem, so there must be something wrong on my end. If they want to break up, that's fine and that's their choice, but it really hurts to be told that everything is fine and then a few days later to get hit up with the ""we're just not working out"" talk. Honestly, only a few have had the decency to actually tell me they're breaking up. The rest have just ghosted.  


I have anxiety and I do my best to manage it. It causes me to overthink thinks and makes me paranoid of myself. For a few years, I tried being the ""cool girl"" do whatever they wanted, never cause an argument, avoided confrontation. Basically I was just arm candy. I think maybe I was ""too available"" and it turned these men off, they got bored with me, and just strung me along.  


So I gave it another approach with a completely different type of guy once I got into my 20's. We had similar values and  became friends first, I met him through a hobby group. We had incredibly chemistry and basically became best friends while we dated. After a few months, he became kinda distant and it worried me but then he invited me to meet his family on a trip and I went thinking that our relationship was on solid ground now. To make a long story short, on the trip he basically ditched me to hang out with his brothers. His older brother was kind of rude to me and it makes me think that maybe he talked shit about me to him and that turned him off. I don't know. Anyways, I finally confronted him about it on our last night there and he said he didn't mean to exclude me, he was just happy to see his bros.  


We got home and he became distant again. I wondered if maybe he was seeing someone else but he wasn't. I asked him again if things were ok and he said they were. After months of this, I got so tired of being treated like a chore and he only would talk to me a couple times a week. I broke it off. He seemed unphased by it. I never got closure as to why he abandoned me on that trip. I kept thinking that maybe I wasn't attractive enough, or if I said something that offended him or maybe he was too embarrassed to be with me around his family. It ate me up inside.  


  
I don't know what I'm doing wrong here, but I'd like to know. I really want to work on myself. I try my hardest to not be one of those clingy partners, but then I don't want to seem uninterested either. I think maybe it's a respect problem. They don't respect me for some reason. How can I be respected and prioritized? I've only dated the regular guy-next-door type so I'm not sure why it's so complicated for me. I see other women and they make it look effortless. I see these women and their boyfriends/husbands prioritize them. You can see that they really care about how these women feel. I feel like I'm defective because I've never had that very \*normal\* part of a relationship.   


I'm not dating again until I get this sorted out.",AskMen,1538896735,ladysnickerdoodle,7,1,True,2018-10-07

Do guys actually like being hugged? How much or when does it make sense to hug someone?,"Earlier today I was meeting up with some of my friends. I hadn't seen one of them in a while and I was feeling really cheerful so I walked up behind him and hugged him around the waist. He seemed like he appreciated it, but later on when he had left, one of my other friends commented on how it's a little weird that I do that to people and that it's ""kind of a girlfriend thing."" 

They mentioned that I do it a lot to people and it's cute but strange. I felt a little bad because i thought it made people feel better and now I don't really know when it would be appropriate. 

Also, though I like giving hugs, I get a little anxious when i get one, so I was also wondering if you guys enjoy them at all.

I'm female and got rejected by 3 guys at the bar. What can I do to improve?,"Hey there! 24F women here. Tonight I approached three different guys at the bar. I wanted to be more confident and talk/meet more guys since I'm single. I got rejected three times and I'm feeling pretty bummed about it :( 
But I'm glad to know they weren't interested and I can move on. I just want to know if I did something wrong or what I can do to improve for next time. 

Background about me:
I would say I'm an extroverted introvert. Sometimes shy but can be outgoing when I want to be. I had some alcohol in me (2 shots) so I wasn't scared to approach them. I'm not ugly by any means. A lot of guys think I'm a robot on dating apps cause they say I'm too pretty. I used to live in NYC and would get hit on all the time at the bars. And I'm not overweight at all. I'm 5 ft tall (very petite) and size 0. And Asian. 

Bar Scene: 
In a prominently white populated city in the Midwest. 90% population is blondes. So maybe I didn't stand a chance at the bar compared to all the blondes there? At a country bar out with two of my friends who I would say are attractive. Both friends are skinny and we know how to be stylish. 

1st guy I approached: 
I asked him if he liked the country music playing in the bar. I saw that he had two of his friends with him as well. They looked over a few times and they seem to keep looking in our direction. So I approached the guys. They took interest immediately. And then my two friends also came over. They all said they liked country and asked what music we liked. I said indie and gave some artists of the top of my head. I touched one of the guys shirts and made a comment about it. Physical touch is important when flirting right? Could not tell if the guy was comfortable with it. He was very neutral. Made some more small talk and then they said they were going to be right back and get more drinks. 

After they came back the conversion kinda died. My friends and I asked ALL the questions. These guys were like bricks on a wall. So dull. When we found out they were all 22 years old still in school. They asked how old we were. I said we're all 24. I think that really turned them off or something cause a little after that they said they were going to a different bar to find a friend. But they never left! So they low key rejected us. 
Did I make physical contact way to early? :/ 
Or were we too old for them? 

2nd guy:
I was going to approach but he came over cause I kept looking over at him. Talked to everyone in my friend group. Kept giving me eye contact though and his feet were pointed towards me so I thought he was def interested in me! Then two girls came over and were literally all over him. The girls kept hugging him really tightly. He hugged them but came back to us so I assumed they were his friends and not his girlfriend and gfs friend. We talked more and then the other girls took him away again. So I assumed he was taken, or a big fuckboy. Then he came back again. He wanted us to meet his two other guy friends (who were also handsome). We told him we're going to do shots and you're welcome to join us. He joined us. My friends and I ordered our shots and paid. Then we see the two girls dragging him away and he went away with them. So I just said oh well the guy is already taken. This guy kept showing back up though. Not sure what his end goal was? A big orgy with like 5 girls? We never got introduced to his other friends :(

I don't really know what I could have done to improve here? I didn't want to play his game of play hard to get. Do you think I should have tried harder or I did the right thing? 

3rd guy:
I noticed he was wearing my alumni schools logo so I made a comment about it. He seemed happy and interested. Tried to talk to him more but he seemed like he was not into it? His friend left and he followed his friend so I guess he didn't like me at all :( I found out he had a weird gap between his teeth. Felt kinda bad that not even an average looking guy would like me. 

Basically felt like shit after the third guy and felt really ugly which I've never really felt before. Usually in NYC I would have guys talking to me already. Was it just a bad night with the wrong crowd (Midwest guys versus East coast guys)? Maybe I'm just secretly ugly? Or I just had really bad game tonight? Like if this was a test def got a F on it. Seemed like NONE of the guys flirted back.

How to stop falling for female friends?,"Hi, I have (had) this self-destructive pattern from age 16 to 23. I'd get to know a nice girl, she is pretty, smart and what have you.

Eventually they get a boyfriends and they I do or say something to make them avoid me or cut me out all together. Now this happen with every girl luckily. In total 5 times. However at age 23 this happen with a girl who was a very, very important friend. Like, she influence my life quite a lot. Loosing her was a huge blow.

How has your taste in music changed over the years?,"Mine has expanded greatly, although it was never a truly narrow focus. I grew up in the late 90s and 2000's, and I genuinely liked a bit of the pop music from that time period. At the same time I've always liked artists like Paul Kelly, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, and others I suppose from that style of easy to listen to pop music throughout the decades. Growing up hip hop was always a treat, the first 3 Eminem albums were amazing to me, I loved the Power of the Dollar mixtape, Jay Z in general had a lot of playtime.

I remmber I turned about 15 and started listening more to edm, classic trance songs held a shitload of appeal (hated dubstep with a passion, and it seemed to drown Australian radio in the late 2000's), Tiesto, A state of trance from 2006-2009.

Classical music didn't do a whole heap for me though, even though I played the Clarinet passingly well. This has changed and prompted this post, the last few weeks I've been listening to some truly beautiful music such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons, anything at all by Liszt, Beethoven and Mozart, Tchaikovsky has a literal banger.

How do I man up and get over losing the woman I love?,"I'm having severe issues seeing hope for the future.

Short story: I'm the type of guy that is scared of being abandoned, which led my to spend time alone and ultimately neglect her during the summer holidays where I was just in my cave. She is the type of woman that is anxious, she needs lots of attention. This led to her wanting to break up second last Monday.

At first I couldn't believe it and just went into self protection mode, but 3 days later I started doing everything in my power to talk to her and pour my heart out. She agreed to meet on the same day and we talked. Then it was impossible for her to make time until this last Thursday, where we met again and sat in the cold and talked for 3 hours.

There were tears, there was anger, the journey to this talk was emotionally the hardest time of my life. Not over exaggerating. I love her and thats what I let her know too. I poured my heart out and everything I learned, ultimately being that relationships are work, and that I'm ready to do what it takes to have her by my side in my life. Go through life together.

It comes down to us both having made mistakes. Her mistake being too quiet about what she wants. She admitted to having the rather unrealistic wish of me being able to tell when something is important to her just by her asking. And my mistake not being open enough about my feelings (none of this would've happened if I showed my love for her more clearly). She said that despite everything, she considers herself unable to look past t what happens and considers the relationship in repairable.

I walked her home. We didn't talk at all while walking, but at her doorstep she said she was happy I insisted on bringing her home. We hugged for what felt like forever. And then... She kissed me. We kissed for some minutes as if nothing ever happened. She said that she just wanted a last kiss. My last words to her were that I love her. Then she went inside.

I don't know how to ever find somebody better or equal to her. Everything about us was a fairytale. We're both professional musicians and of same age (27/28).

I just don't know how to look towards the future. And I'm really trying... ",AskMen,1538919756,jaylawl,0,1,True,2018-10-07

It caught me off guard, but the drunk version of me was lkke ""ill figure this out in the morning"" we hold hands, make out, walk back to my place, do adult things, she spends the night and we cuddle.

I was already planning date 2, and i called her the next day. She could tell i waa so so about her having a son, she called things off, and i go into a 4 week long drinking binge.

I have tickets to see Hamilton here in Chicago for next Friday. And after failed attempts to find a friend who wants to go, or even other redditors, tinder etc i decided I'd reach out to her. She said she would love to go.

During my therapy session immediately after she broke things off, i started taking about my childhood and how my mom was raised by her non biological parents, my dad was as well, my mkm raised a son that wasn't hers (i call him my brother but we have no relation) his mom is sitll alive but he calls my mom ""mom""

My half sisters all call my dad (not their dad) dad, my step dad helped raise me as well as my own dad.

Im childfree, bur i never decided if being a step das was for me or not. But i think of all the amazing experiences in my crazy nom traditional family and i think, what if i could keep the tradition?

I broke down in tears imagining this adorable possibly nerdy boy who probably was similar to me at my age. I assume hes nerdy because his mom is smart AF, and all the men in her family are engineers. Im an engineer too.

So, what is it like being a step dad?",AskMen,1537583882,kittenlover27,16,5,True,2018-09-21

"The way I look seems to completely dictate my mood for the day, how do I fix this?","This problem probably seems really irrelevant to a lot of you guys, especially because I‚Äôm 16 and this sounds like some pointless teenager issue, but this has been bugging me a lot lately. 

I had my first girlfriend around the beginning of this year (broke up a few months ago) and she was kinda an ego boost for me because she was really hot. I went through a period where I was incredibly insecure, but pretty much got past that while we were together. 

Ever since we broke up, I‚Äôve been way too fixated on how I look. I‚Äôll always try to casually look at myself in the mirror and even overanalyze female attention to try and use it as validation. If I feel ugly, my whole day is pretty much ruined, and vice versa. I‚Äôve been told I have a pretty good personality and I even think that myself, so I‚Äôm not sure why I put so much value in my appearance. 

I‚Äôve always kinda thought/been told that I‚Äôm pretty attractive, so I guess I identified with that. I heard that a group of girls called me ugly a little while ago and that sorta broke down my ego and made me question myself a lot, it still does. 

Does anyone have any experience with this problem or any advice?

"Lads who have dated around a bit, how often do you come across a girl with these traits?","Hi all!

I've   done up a brief list of traits that I hope to look for in a partner   (female aged between 25-30) and would love some feedback on if you think   these are reasonable or not. I have not included looks in here on   purpose but they do definitely play a part as it must be a physical and   mental attraction; however, I feel as though looks are really reflected   by personality - a really good looking person will be brought down by   personality flags and vice versa.

The traits are:

1. kind/compassionate
2. confident in their abilities but not egotistical about them
3. Has   their own passions/interests ie. this could be science, sport,  fashion,  cooking, whatever as long as its something they enjoy doing  that a  partner can also get into
4. comfortable being alone/introverted at times/not dependent on partner to provide entertainment all the time
5. Smart  enough to critically analyse the world around us /- not strongly  religious /-  able to notice that there's nothing wrong with being  religious though  if it makes someone a better person; unlike some  aggressive atheists /- appreciates science and understand it determines  the rules of the world around us /- happily curious about the world
6. clean (to be more precise, not a hoarder; can keep a neat house; not obsessive though)
7. close with family
8. has good healthy group of friends
9. organised (to an extent; no ones always organised)
10. enjoys movies
11. adventurous
12. enjoys their work
13. enjoys exercising/being healthy (of course enjoys a good McDonalds cheeseburger or drink at times too)

As   a note, I also understand that the partner to this person has to have   their stuff together too and has to be deserving of such a person. I'm   moreso interested in understanding if it's reasonable to look for all  of  these traits in one person.",AskMen,1537588928,FootballFanatic1189,32,0,True,2018-09-21

I just learned that a guy I thought was a close friend slept with a mutual friend who he knew I loved. What do?,"Also, I live with her (which I realize was probably a huge mistake, but we had been close friends for a while and I had my feelings subdued and handled, I thought anyway, when I made the decision)

When I realized I had feelings for her, he was one of the first people I confided in. Since then, I've had more conversations than I can recall with him about how I genuinely love her, even if she doesn't feel the same. 

I recently returned from a short trip, and recognized something was different. Confronted him today, and he said he has feelings for her, and didn't deny anything when I said that I assume he slept with her. I thoroughly chewed him out for a while, and told him that if this is something he's going to pursue, then I'm done with him.

I'm more unsure about how to handle the female friend. She didn't know just how strongly I feel about her, just that a few months ago I told her that I had feelings for her, and we've stayed friends since.

What do you do when girlfriend sucks at sex?,"We‚Äôve been together for about 6 months now. For the first three months we were not in the same town but had been talking online as she would be transferring to the same college. We would sext often and she would always initiate it. She would tell me all of this stuff that she was going to do and tell me that guys always told her she was the best sex they ever had. I understand sexting could be over exaggerated but she would say this even when we finally physically saw each other. 

She would tell me she was going to ride me and that her favorite position was cowgirl and that she loved doggystyle and a bunch of other lies. The first time we had sex I asked her if she could get on top and she said no and that we would do that in a more special or celebratory time. She just laid there while I did the work. I just thought maybe she was nervous. Now we have sex almost everyday and it‚Äôs just for the sake of saying we do because I get nothing from it and she barely acts like she‚Äôs enjoying it. When we finally did do doggy, she wouldn‚Äôt even arch her back and I could barely do anything without her saying it hurt. I asked her to get on top another time and she was just burning rubber. I got nothing out of it. It didn‚Äôt look good and it didn‚Äôt feel good. Now we pretty much only ever do it in missionary. She still says things like ‚ÄúI wanna ride you tonight‚Äù as if it‚Äôs a treat. It hasn‚Äôt improved at all. 

I wonder if she even knows that she really isn‚Äôt as good as she thinks she is. Do I tell her? Do I also address the fact that she hyped her skills up and pretty much lied because she can‚Äôt do anything she said she could?

I walked outside and saw her talking to a man so I walked over there and yelled ‚ÄúHEY B, IM GOING TO GRAB YOUR SHOES‚Äù and the man walked away.

Possible FWB scenario with an ex. How do I proceed?,"So we dated for 5 months and split up after I wanted to be serious and she didn't. It was an amicable split. She wanted to stay friends and after thinking about it for a couple of days, I agreed.

After 3 weeks of basically no-contact. I reached out to say hi and talk about some work issues I was having. I was thinking about taking another job elsewhere. We texted for a while and she suggested that my problems seem to be something we should be talking over drinks. I suggested meeting that weekend and we met at our usual bar.

The whole thing went very well. We vibed like usual, got drunk and had a lot of fun. Danced on the floor, kissed each other on the cheeks. Even made some new friends there and made tentative plans to go fishing with them.

After leaving the bar I suggested going to my place for hookah. She agreed and while smoking she lay her head on my shoulder and then on my lap. I made a move at this point but she stopped me. We then ended up sleeping and cuddling. When she was leaving in the morning I tried to kiss her goodbye but she backed away again and presented her cheek for a kiss.

I am very clear that there is no long term relationship possibility here and I think so is she. We have fun together and both of us are rational people so we could be like FWB or even casually date until one of finds somebody serious.

So how do I proceed from here?",AskMen,1537635781,pa_one,0,2,True,2018-09-22

How to deal with a rude female team leader at work?,"No one has to read this or reply but i had to let it out. I know the situation isn't that 'bad' but it's very degrading and i feel like hell whenever i'm around her.

I have worked for this company for over 1 year in a full-time casual role (meaning 5 days a week, but still as casual employment). There is approximately 50 or so employees and from the statistics, i am one of the best performing. They even had me managing one of the four sections of the company this week for 3 days. Job: Logistics/Warehousing.

Now about the team leader:

- She is never impressed with the work that anyone does. It's not just me though - she constantly degrades everyone even if you complete the task to the best of your abilities. A few times she needed me to complete a task with 2 hours to go and i tried my absolute hardest to complete it but didn't finish it on time. I returned the remainder of the work and she just shakes her head and says ""bye"". My motivation and work ethic decreases a lot. 

And the ""task"" doesn't have to be completed by one person as multiple employees work together on it. 

- Always grumpy and has either an angry or monotone face 99% of the time. The only time that she smiles or laughs is when she tells me that ""you're slow because you're talking to others"" even if she doesn't see me talking just to see my reaction. Talking to workmates shouldn't be an issue anyway if you work at the same pace or above compared to the employee average which is what i do. She tries to create a death camp scenario where no one is allowed to talk. Productivity increases when employees are enjoying work...

- Manager won't do anything because they have no one else to do her job.

- Multiple people have left the company due to her and 80% of people have the same issue as me. Many people fear her as well. The only people that she is nice to is some other females and people above her.

- The company is quite large and there are 4 or 5 people above her rank. Whenever they are close by, her mood changes to be positive. It's like she is another person... very weird.",AskMen,1536302161,someone3245,4,2,True,2018-09-06

So, I've been ""trapped"" in this ""relationship"" for about 3 years now. I love the girl. From my side, I could spend the rest of my life with her. I fear I may never meet someone that I get along with as well as I do her. 

It's been the strangest ride of my life. We have been exclusive in the past. She initiated the idea and I was all for it. Eventually she brought up the idea of marriage. I was taken by surprise of course. It's a scary thing, but I agreed to the idea. Nothing was ever set in stone, an official engagement never happened. She then broke it off within less than a year of being committed. She did so because she ""wasn't sure."" I of course was devastated as I was under the impression I had found my partner for the rest of my life.

We have been on and off, with no real significant amount of time away from each other this entire time. To me, she is just as addicted to me as I am her. It's irrational. I don't know what holds her back from making the commitment and giving into it fully. But she can't seem to let me go. Same goes for me.

I've been stuck on her for a long time like I said. I have gone on two dates with others since I've met her, one recently. I wasn't even interested in the first girl I went on a date with. I just did it to do it. Maybe because I was going insane and wanted to make an effort to do something different. Needless to say, I went right back to the comfort of ""Liz"".

My mental health lately has been absolutely horrible. Among other things going on / big changes in my life, I just can't come to terms with the fact that the woman I love isn't ready after all this time to move forward with our relationship. It drives me insane and causes deep dark depression when I am away from her. Of course there is all kinds of negative self-talk and questions that I ask myself. Jealousy. Frustration. I'm sure some of you know what I'm talking about.

I have not been pushy. I feel as though I've been very patient. She hasn't been pushing me back really. It's as if she wants a relationship without labeling it or establishing any type of security that I desire. If she had it her way we would hang out as much as possible. 

I've lately been pulling back in an effort to protect myself. I told her a couple weeks ago that I just can't do it anymore. I can't continue to give her my whole self if she isn't willing to do the same in return. Afterwards, I felt so different about life. It was as if life was being seen through a different lens. Positivity. I was a different person and felt so good. 

I went to a music festival the following weekend. It was an amazing time and out of my comfort zone. I had a date with a very attractive young woman who was actually very cool for the most part. I had a good time. It went well and it was refreshing.

Less than a week later I craved the comfort of cuddling up with her and just having a relaxing night. Stupid I know. It's insanity. Thinking that anything would be different and that it would be a good idea was just foolish. Sure, it was nice. However I've found myself just once more back in the same mindset that I had prior to making the decision to strive for something better. Negative, looking for escapes from reality, not taking care of myself/loving myself as I had begun to before I ""relapsed"" on hanging out with ""Liz"".

At this point, I'm not terribly interested in other women. I've never been a cheater and always a one-at-a-time kind of guy even without commitment. Which I know many would argue is not smart. It's just the way that I seem to operate.

I don't understand my obsession. I don't understand my self-destructive tendencies. Logically none of this makes sense for me to think or act the way that I do. But I guess love is not logical.

Last night once again after a week of her acting as if things were normal again and myself questioning my very existence and the correctness of my actions... I told her (very simplified from our actual conversation) that it was a mistake to think that we could hang out again. It was as difficult of a conversation if not more so than the first time.

I am still finding myself constantly thinking of her and feeling sorry for it not working out the way that I wanted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I would ask you guys is:

Have you ever been in a similar situation?

How did you get out? Obviously stopping and disconnecting is the easy answer to that... but anything additional you can tell me I would appreciate.

When does the pain end?

Is it wrong for me to want to actually end things so she can realize in my absence that she is missing out on someone who would actually be there for her in every possible sense? Maybe then she would have a true change of heart. I just can't seem to muster up feelings of hate or animosity towards her despite her selfishness in letting me suffer wanting more and not giving me more.

Any advice?

How do you know if you're being led on?,"There's this girl I work with and she's always been kinda flirty with me but a couple of weeks ago she invited me to go out to a club with her and her friends. The whole night she practically didn't leave my side and even took the necklace I was wearing and wore it for a week straight.



So Tuesday comes around and she sends me a message that she's at a restaurant and then says ""you should take me"". So fair enough I said yeah and we went. She then started to refer to it as a mate date. The next day she asked text me and said ""ugh no one wants to come a walk with me"". So I said I'd go but I'm going out at half 9 and then she quickly changed the subject but offered me a lift to the place I was going. 



I've known her for over a year and I'm just wondering to myself why if you just want to be friends did you not start wanting to do this 6 months ago? Maybe I'm just looking into it too much.



I've talked it out with a few pals already and it's just completely messing my head about. Both the people I talked to said I need to tell her I like her but I've mad anxiety issues and I'm just stuck.



I don't wanna make shit awkward cos at the end of the day I have to work with her. I'm almost certain she knows I like her anyway cos I'm not the most discreet of people and someone else I work with said they could see it from miles away that I like her.



Most of the time all she talks about is boys she's been with. She's a genuinely lovely girl but I just don't wanna end up getting hurt. She's also wanting to go to the cinema at some point.

-6:15pm - 8:45pm: training
I am a full-time PhD student, but mostly work from home and set my own schedule, so I am far freer than he is even though I train in the evenings as well.

What's the funniest/ worst case you've seen where a guy is trying to impress a girl and it backfired on him?,"A buddy of mine from High School were reminiscing and we remembered something that made us laugh for almost an hour.

Back in High School, we were playing in a basketball league and it was the semi-finals.  The guy who was playing as our point guard brought his girlfriend to watch the game.  The game was close, neither team was ahead by more than 4 points.  

In the last 3 minutes of the game our opponents were ahead by 4 and our point guard (his name was Noel) decided to try to take 3 point shots every chance he could to try to win the game and impress his girl.  Except he missed 3 consecutive ones which the other team grabbed the rebound and scored against us.  Now they were up by 10.  

On the fourth possession, as he was bringing the ball down to our court, his girlfriend yelled ""For God's sake Noel pass the God Damn Ball!!!  You have four other guys in your team.""  Pretty much the everybody in the court started laughing.  We lost the game, but walked away with that awesome memory.

How would handle someone driving into your car and running away if there was no damage to your car?," 

My boss claims someone bumped off his car this morning and drove away without leaving a note or informing him. The reason I say ""claims"" is because:

1. He didn't see it, just heard a bang from around the corner and then saw the car driving away. We work around a place that has delivery trucks opening and closing doors and moving shit all day.
2. He checked our CCTV and claims you can see the crash, but it's super hard to see and is only the smallest possible ding if there is anything.
3. There is zero damage to the car, except maybe his hubcap being dented. Which again he claims is clearly a new dent but I am not sure.

He's currently getting CCTV off other businesses around us and trying to contact the cops about it.

Now, if the car was damaged in any way, I'd understand what he's doing, especially if he was super into his car. Likewise, if he physically saw the crash, I'd understand too. But he isn't and he didn't. His car is a old beater that isn't worth much and the hubcap that is maybe damaged is basically worth nothing. The cops aren't going to give a fuck about something this small.

I think he's completely wasting his time, but some colleagues have said I'm being too laid back and I'm ""letting the guy off the hook"" but I think I'm just being realistic and my boss is focusing waaaaaay to hard on trying to get revenge on the guy.

How would you feel about a girl you barely know sending you an Insta DM saying she‚Äôs into you?,"Hello! I need some advice on how to approach a guy I like because, Carpe Diem! (Feeling inspired after watching the Dead Poets Society lol and I believe it‚Äôs an awesome way to live)

Context: I‚Äôm a girl in her mid 20s who likes a guy also in his mid 20s. I barely know him and have only spoken to him a handful of times. He is a waiter/bartender at a local restaurant and my ex boyfriend knew him through the local music scene they‚Äôre both apart of. So whenever we would go to this pub and he was our server, my ex and him would talk about their musical endeavours and I would throw in the occasional question or comment. We went there quite often and he got to know me a little bit by association. I always thought this guy was very attractive which is rare for me to think because I‚Äôm usually not drawn to men based on their looks initially. It takes time for me to crush on someone. I also think he has a lot of substance to him which also makes him incredibly sexy. Now that I‚Äôm single, I‚Äôd like to tell him how I feel. I followed him on Instagram a few months back and he followed me back. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm a complete stranger, but still, I hardly know him. 

It‚Äôs not really feasible for me to get to know him organically in real life so I wanted to tell him I‚Äôm interested in him by sending him a quick message on Insta. 

My question for guys is: would you welcome this approach from a girl you don‚Äôt know well (assuming you find her attractive)? And what‚Äôs the best way to put my interest for him into words to get the best outcome? (Ideal outcome would be getting to know him and hopefully dating)

I realized I said something terrible to a male friend of mine and I need to apologize. What is the best way to make it up to him?,"TL;DR Said a mean thing to someone I care about. Need help with the best way to apologize and move forward.

I have a friend, ‚ÄúChase‚Äù who I‚Äôve been hanging out with for about a year now. We have sleepovers and act as a couple when we go out together but he‚Äôs never made a move to make us any more serious even though I have made my romantic feelings for him pretty clear. We‚Äôre just friends who make out and cuddle sometimes and that‚Äôs okay with me.

We have a trip coming up on Thursday and I‚Äôm staying with him tomorrow night so we can just get up and go first thing the following day. I realize that when I go over there tomorrow I need so immediately apologize for something very fucked up that I said.

The Sunday before last, he was out of town for work so we FaceTimed to go over last minute trip details. We ended up talking about this and that for a couple of hours and just generally had a nice conversation until we got on the topic of dating in general. I stupidly said that even though I like him I could never date him and when he asked why I told him that he was an alcoholic. A functioning one, but still has some trouble with controlling his drinking and that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to raise a family with someone like that. He sort of laughed it off and I didn‚Äôt even realize what I said because he‚Äôs such a closed off person who doesn‚Äôt display many emotions, I sometimes forget that he‚Äôs a human being with complex feelings. 

So with what I said, I basically implied that because of his drinking he is unworthy of being loved or having a family and that is SUCH a fucked up and stupid thing to say to someone. He is such a wonderful and caring person and he is more than deserving of every happiness that life has to offer. I feel like such a piece of garbage and even worse that I didn‚Äôt even realize how shitty it was until yesterday when I noticed he hadn‚Äôt returned my call and text from the weekend. 

I feel horrible and I have been having trouble deciding whether to go ahead and call him or just apologize in person when I get to his house tomorrow evening. I thought about bringing him flowers and immediately acknowledging what I said and profusely apologize. I don‚Äôt want to bombard him with ‚Äúsorrys‚Äù and overwhelm him but I also want him to know that I was very much in the wrong for what I said and that I am very sorry. 

I just want to get this out in the air so that we can discuss this and have a fun trip but he hates talking about emotional things so I‚Äôm not sure how to go about this.

It's almost as if entire conversations or events get warped and turned around in ways I cant figure out. For instance, last night after walking home from a bar, my friend (female) and I started voicing our opinions about a political issue and she began screaming and saying F you, when i raised my voice slightly out of frustration she claimed I was yelling at her and that im a monster. when I apologized and adjusted my tone she said I was ""manspalining"". All I was doing was apologizing for raising my voice. She then took a left turn and said I dont understand what it's like to be female or be raped because I'm male, gender had zero relevance to our conversation and i still dont understand how gender got brought into the conversation. This is only one instance of a female friend twisting a con conversation and making it something
it's not.  

This doesn't happen with any of my male friends. I can't help but wonder if all women are crazy and I just didn't see it before. 

Does anyone else experience this?

Infertility,"I've now had 3 different men tell me that if they were infertile, they would not want the woman to be inseminated but instead adopt so that both parents would be ""even"" in the parenting process.

A little background: my soon to be ex husband and I tried for a long, long time with no success. When we were first referred to specialists for testing, he told me that if it was his fault, he would not be ok with me being inseminated. He felt it wouldn't be fair. 

Find out it is mostly my fault...and we try IVF but I am a-ok with using a surrogate if it eventually gets to that point.

We end up splitting (he cant take the infertility journey). 

I have one good Male friend who did not know our story but HIM and his wife were having problems and he said the same thing to me.

And THEN! I go on a date with a guy this last weekend. He had to have chemo years ago which caused him to be sterile and now he is telling me the same thing! Him and his ex girlfriend broke up because he didn't want her carrying another man's child and she wanted to experience pregnancy and childbirth.

What is this pattern? Is this common? My first thought when I first started on the infertility journey was that even if it was my fault and I could not carry or produce eggs, I would want our children to at least have my husbands DNA. I thought if we were a unit then at least one of us could share our families DNA. 

For some reason, the only 3 men I've had conversations about this with were 100% against the woman being able to experience pregnancy and use insemination.

I'm concerned this is a common theme and it makes me sad to think a future partner would want to eliminate the experience of pregnancy because they cant contribute (via their own sperm) to it. 

How do I talk to them about this without sounding like I'm disregarding their concerns? I dont even know why they would feel this way. Please shed some light!",AskMen,1533705694,icu_qser,1,1,True,2018-08-07

How do I take some of the edge off to remain professional/friendly in a work environment?,"I‚Äôm in a position where I could see a promotion come my way if I got better at customer interactions, and generally holding my shit together tighter. I don‚Äôt become incompetent under pressure, I just have a tendency to cope with pressure through lashing out it ways that, while not directed at colleagues or customers, are found to be off putting by coworkers at times as well as management.

This is a tendency my father had as well, although his was more often directed at others as well as himself.

I‚Äôm good at acting like a generally nice person in front of customers, as well as colleagues, although I‚Äôve been known to be somewhat spicy or overbearing in interactions with teammates during particularly busy times , although it is typically with good reason, as management will often point out.

The main thing standing in my way, I feel, is my current inability to dull down the edge that made me good at my job at first, and become someone less likely to be perceived as a loose cannon or otherwise inflammatory. I need to become someone more personable, and become reliable as a preemptive conflict deescalator, which is expected of managers in my field. - this is difficult given the natural edge my personality has. 

For context, I‚Äôm in food service.

Tl;dr: I want a promotion, but can‚Äôt cuz I‚Äôm mad all the time, and I‚Äôd rather not be. I‚Äôd also like to work on social mindfulness. Priesh.",AskMen,1532411357,BigG7615,17,3,True,2018-07-23

How do you become less 'dopey' and increase attentiveness and awareness in everyday tasks?,"This question stems from my experiences when working in the construction industry. Relatively intelligent, but more 'carefree' and  'dopey'. Started a job with a friend who is on the ball and has been more of a ""hands-on"" kind of guy. Knows how to tow boats, tie down long timber to top of trucks, knows how to take initiative and can follow instructions from the boss well.

I try really hard to be more attentive, but I just can't do it. For example, there was a little concrete strip that had been laid a day ago and was still moist right near we were working. My friend said ""don't step on it, it's still sort of fresh"" and about 5 mins later when the boss came over to check on us, I accidentally stepped on it. Thank god it didn't do any damage because it was nearly dry, but I looked like an idiot in front of my boss. Another example was when I was to get my first pay check. I gave my bank details to the lady in the office, and it wasn't coming through for some reason. I went to see her to cross check it and I accidentally put a wrong number in the card number. Right in front of the boss. So embarrassing. 

I've always been naturally free-spirited, my mind wanders and an introvert. The thing is that I'm not a slacker and work incredibly hard and bust my ass. I just have a really hard time in this aspect.

***TL;DR -*** *I keep messing up at work. Not because I don't care or that I'm lazy, but that I'm a bit 'dopey'... How can I curb this personality trait at work?*",AskMen,1532433325,sabethrowaway,33,42,True,2018-07-24

Meeting women,"I'm 36 (I don't look 36, most people reckon I'm in my mid 20s ) and I live in the UK.
I've not had a gf or date in about 6-7 years. This is starting to really get me down, and is now having the affect of turning me into a miserable bastard much of the time. I have a very high sex drive, and as it happens I enjoy female company. I'm short (5'4) and not bad looking, in decent shape and great hair (permed), yes.. Great... but I'm certainly not the hot super guy most women seem to think they're entitled to these days. In the past I've always done alright when I've got to know women. I might not catch a woman's eye like a tall good looking man, but through experience I've learnt once women get talking to me they tend to dig my manner and ability to charm. I seem to do alright. So for me this is a 'meeting women' issue, not a 'I lack confidence around women or I feel ugly and rejected' etc. 

I'm now in a situation where I'm not meeting any women at all. I don't meet women at work and I don't lead the kind of social life that results in meeting lots of women... (does anybody?) 
I've tried tinder, but whoa and behold if it's not the most shallow thing ever. After swiping right and going through over 1000 women, I didn't get one match. I'm in Northern England, so the catchment and population size isn't exactly NYC. 

At 36 most of my friends are tied up with work and family life, so if I go to bars I pretty much have to go on my own, which in my experience is a dreadful affair. Needless to state I don't meet anybody. I'm not that great in bar settings however. I don't drink, I'm not like the merry crowd, dancing to shite music, and I find it hard to join in. That's not to say I don't have a sense of humour, quite the opposite, but I'm not one of getting steaming drunk just to prove I'm fun. 
Laslty, I want to meet younger women. I'm not at all interested in meeting women my age or above. There are reasons for this, but I feel no need to go into them. So in terms of meeting women... Realistically what choices do I have these days? 

Online dating is all about women accepting you.. And that doesn't seem to happen to me. 
And going to bars doesn't work for me. 
I'm stuck.. And worried for the future, if I'm honest.

Guys of Reddit: Have your 20s lived up to expectations socially? How do I get past the regrets over my 20s being a social failure?,"I've spent almost my entire 20s with practically no real social life. This contrasts with 90% of people in their 20s who have bustling social lives. It's making me awfully regretful and depressed. Well-adjusted social guys make multiple friends of both sexes during their 20s. 

Most people spend their 20s going to fun activities with friends, out to meals with friends, and out to bars or clubs in groups some weekends. I've had sporadic nights out over the years, but they've become few and far between. 

I'm now 28 and I've been on a night out with more than one person three times this entire year. Mostly, I'd go to a pub with one friend or to one friend's house and we'd have a chat and a couple beers, but there's no real diversity, and not much fun either. 

I had huge expectations for my 20s and I don't think those expectations were out of touch with reality. For example, I bet 99% of people who went to college had a blast of a time and made friends for life. I literally showed up for lectures and went home each day as I lived near my college campus. I didn't join clubs or fuck girls like every other college guy. 

I was a bit shy in school but always had friends, however, in college, my anxieties were really amplified and I still feel those anxieties today. I see pics of people on social media, showing guys I was in college with (but who I didn't really connect with) and I just know they've all spent their 20s sharing experiences together, going on nights out and what not. 

I simply can't get over the feeling that my youth has been an utter waste of time. I can only see it getting worse as I enter my 30s lamenting lost time while nobody else my age will be looking to make new friends or party or connect with new people as they've done it all in their 20s. 

Thanks in advance for any comments or advice.

How to deal with dating someone over weight?,"Female here..

Let me start by saying I love my boyfriend &amp; he is all I want. I met my bf through social media 2 years ago. I knew what he looked liked, but it wasn‚Äôt until I met him face to face how over weight he is. I didn‚Äôt let this affect the progression of our relationship because I am head over heels for who he is and how he makes me feel. However, he is really self conscious mainly because of his weight. I‚Äôm fit and take very good care of my overall health and appearance. Compared to me he is really big, and people give me weird looks when we are together in public. It really sucks because he notices it too. I feel guilty for sometimes being embarrassed being seen with him in public when people give us stares. It also sucks that my family isn‚Äôt too fond of his weight and my brothers have made jokes about him. He was a skinny kid growing up but his whole family now is over weight and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs genetic or not. My bf wants to work out, but eating better is his main issue. He still lives at home with his family who cooks unhealthy and eats out a lot so he is sort of forced to have what they eat. I want to help him but I don‚Äôt know how considering the circumstances.

I love him and who he is, but being attracted to him is hard sometimes and I feel so guilty about it. I want to improve his image and health for not only my benefit, but for his confidence. I‚Äôm just not sure he is dedicated enough to go through with losing the weight. Again, I love him and I can‚Äôt picture life without him, but how can I manage to stay in love with someone that doesn‚Äôt take care of their health? This is so hard for me.

Any advice is appreciated &amp; in no way am I shaming overweight people. I‚Äôm just usually attracted to fit men, and this time around I fell in love with his personality before looks.",AskMen,1531104671,021110230,20,8,True,2018-07-08

Any of you guys have some insight as to why something like this would happen?,"I was just informed minutes ago that one of my best freind's father left his family for another woman.  The last time I saw him he seemed like he was in a loving relationship with his wife and loved his three kids to death.  He hasn't reached out to any of them in 20 days.  My friend asked me if I wanted to hang out and I said absolutely! It was before my mom told me about what happened.  He was the exact opposite of what you would assume a man who would leave his wife would be like.  He was a hard-working cop with a witty sense of humor and I can't wrap my head around what happened that made him do this.  Something must of happened. I don't believe he would leave just like that.

My friend doesn't know that I know this and I want her to tell me herself if she's ever ready.

I assume some of you guys have gone through this before.  My question is why?  Why did you leave? Was is something your wife did? Your kids? Did you leave just because?  I just want to understand why such a good man would do something so out of character! 

What's the best thing that I can do for her and her family? I know I should be with her through this but is there anything else that I can do to maybe have her forget negative feelings she might have?  Should I try to keep her and her sisters busy while their mom tries to figure it out? I'm crying right now because I'm imagining how I would feel if my dad, who I love dearly, would leave my mom without any warning for another woman.  It hurts. It hurts so much and to know this is what she and her sisters and her mother feel makes me so sad and depressed and I just want to help but I don't know how.",AskMen,1531108838,Les_Noticeables,2,3,True,2018-07-08

How do you learn to deal with sex shaming/guilt and learn to have kinky sex with someone you love?,"I don't know if anyone can answer this but thought I'd get a male perspective. 
I guess I'm different than most girls because I really like sex, I had lots of casual sex, the kinkier the better type of thing, and I had no feelings for them. I wasn't even attracted to most of my previous sexual partners. I've been shamed by men and other women repeatedly for even simple things, such as claiming that I am able to orgasm through penetration, and they constantly tell me I'm abnormal for simple things like that, and it makes me really upset because what would they think if they knew much worse things about me? For example, I struggled with paraphilias and have done things that most people don't usually believe when I tell them, so you can imagine the judgement there. I also had some negative sexual experiences I guess, that made me perceive that sex is just something you do to get off with people you hate, that it's essentially ""dirty"" or ""taking advantage of someone"" and not something you'd ever do with someone you truly care about.

So although I am very naturally sexual in nature, I have this deep shame about it, and believe that sex is bad like some strict religious person, which I am not. 

I am in love with my bf, and that really sucks for him because now that I love him I am finding it really hard to have sex with him, because I'm afraid of hurting him and treating him ""badly"". And I know that makes no logical sense because ultimately it hurts him when I deprive him of sex, but I still am unable to shake how I feel about him. 
I know I need to deal with my shame in order to overcome this, and somehow get over this belief that sex is something you can only do with casual sex partners and that it's harmful to those you care about. 
I've heard people describe making love... I really just want to view him as a stranger and get really kinky. Because I don't know how that can happen if we care about each other?",AskMen,1531110901,MeditatingLobster,40,0,True,2018-07-08

What is the truth about party girls vs. conservative girls?,"I'm a girl in college and I often hear that guys don't want a girl that's hooked up with a lot of guys/done drugs/drinks a lot and they view them as ""used up"". They say they want a girl that's more conservative. But from my experience, I don't see this as being true. Everyone looks down on the conservative girl and call her boring whereas everyone idolizes the party girl. Personally, I'm on the introverted side and do not go out as much as my friends. I am constantly made fun of and my friends who are more of the party types get all the guys. I have never been in a relationship and this is concerning me. What's the truth.

"I want to tell a guy I think he's interesting &amp; attractive, but I have no idea what to tell him that I want to do about it.","So this guy is a free a spirit. He doesn't care what people think, but he does care deeply about their feelings. He also loves animals and also doesn't talk about his life that much. 

One time he said he liked my face and seemed to be flirting with me, then he posted something about having a crush on someone and everybody said it was a girl he met at a convention. The thing is that's fine, I'm not a traditionalist either and I'm not nessiceraily looking for a traditional relationship or sex. I'm OK with a lot of different potential outcomes all except for one: ruining the friendship and/or making things awkward.

I met him a couple years ago but we have only started getting to know each other and hanging out recently. I thought about just saying ""I want to say that I find you interesting and attractive, because I feel better telling you. Sorry, I hope that isn't weird."" the thing is, I don't have a hope or expectation of a certain outcome. I'd rather just avoid the ruined friendship outcome.

If he said he liked someone else and not me or just didn't feel the same I'd say that's fine, I just felt better telling you. 

I just feel like that would ruin the friendship.. I almost want to get a friend to spill the beans but that seems so juvenile. 

I just don't know what to tell him or how to not tell him if I shouldn't. If you knew a women friend was having these thoughts about you, what would you think? Or just what do you think I should do or say?

TL;DR I want to tell a guy friend I find him interesting but I I'm not attached to a certain outcome from that except for I don't want a ruined friendship.

"27 male, stuck in life. Seeking advice.","Background:

I studied engineering and ive worked in 2 companies (a project each) and i dont like what im doing at all. This line of work is absolutely not for me but i dont know which line is.

Ive tried thinking of what i do like and cant come up with anything. I have no hobbies (used to be video games but havent been in months and even that isnt smth i realistically wanna pursue) i have no aspirations, dreams or a passion for anything. I live with my parents (thats the norm here till youre married) and money isnt really an issue so i dont have it as a motivation.

I was in an 11 years relationship (ended last October) that i still am so far from being over, i still love that girl more than anything and shes probably the strongest reason why im scared of quitting my job after this project is over (this month).

When the relationship ended last year i was going through a year of unemployment, drug use, depression and lack of motivation to do anything (including serious job hunting). She was always patient with me and never made me feel like i was a loser or anything even though during that time i became very negligent with her and took her for granted (rarely wanted to go out, picked up phone calls less and less.. etc). She was very motivated, had a dream that she later flew across the world for (1 year course that started last January) and i was just sitting there wasting day after day.

I still have hopes that ill win her back someday (hopefully as soon as shes back or shortly before) and thats why my image in front of her still matters a lot to me. I texted her a few times during the past months, told her i missed her but without pushing much. She was always nice and saying im always gonna be a part of her etc.. weve had friendly short conversations each time but no indication from her that shes interested in getting back together plus she sounds really happy there.

Present:

Im clean now, not depressed, kinda motivated to do smth but dunno what.

Whenever i think of what i want to do in my life after i quit this job i cant help but think of her, how would X sound to her, would she be impressed with X and whatnot as i wanna be in a good shape when shes back here. Its making the toughest question im facing 1000 times harder and i feel stuck.

How do i figure out what i want to do with nowhere to start, and how do i take her out of the picture during that? I know i realistically need to prepare myself for a possible rejection and i wanna kickstart my life independently of that happening or not.

"""You take yourself too seriously."" Well how should I react to being insulted then?","I received this comment a little while ago along with, ""You can be intense,"" and it seems to me that it's a bit unfair.

My friend said that regarding how I take insults or mockery. I cop a bit from time to time due to my appearance (which I can't help). I try to take it well, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't get to me. I don't engage in banter or insult others so this often happens unprovoked.

Being treated like that does anger me but I try and let things slide out of kindness, hoping that those tactless friends will get it out of their system. But I'm not afraid of speaking up either. I draw the line if I'm insulted too many times by someone or if it's in front of a group. I've stood up to multiple friends over the years.

It seems like I've been drawn into a cycle of being insulted, standing up for myself, and then being told that I take myself too seriously. Unfortunately, I think I'd be able to take that advice if I wasn't insulted so often. I don't think it's my fault for starting this.

How to build up trust again?,"Secondary account because my SO knows my main.

So a couple months ago, I caught my SO using Tinder. He tried to lie to me to cover it up and said that he just forgot to delete it when we became exclusive, but I ended up finding out that he was actually talking to a couple of girls on there. I confronted him and he apologized and said that it wasn‚Äôt how it looked. He said he was using it for an ego boost and that he never wanted to actually meet up with any of them. I can understand why he was using Tinder, but I was more upset at the fact that he lied and tried to cover it up. I feel that if he was just honest with me from the start, this would be easier for me to let go.

I forgave him and I just wanted to move on, but I‚Äôve had a hard time trusting him again. Since this was a few months ago, I find that the trust is rebuilding over time, but at a very slow pace. I feel like there isn‚Äôt anything that‚Äôs being done that could help rebuild that trust again quicker. I ask for reassurance from time to time, especially when he goes to get drunk at parties with his friends. However, he acts as if I‚Äôm being annoying when I do this.

I don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt ever tell my SO what he can or cannot do. I‚Äôm just currently lost. I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs trying to heal from this situation.

How to not get kicked out of clubs?,"I've gone clubbing 4 times in the last month and I always get kicked out.

The first time was sort of understandable, I was dancing on a certain area of the stage that I didnt know you couldn't dance on. I was literally in the club for 10 minutes. Idk why the bouncer couldn't of just issued me a warning as it was a honest mistake.

And the other 3 times has always been the same. I got kicked out after being in the club for 20 minutes for being too 'drunk'. In reality I had not even had a sip, I was just getting lit on the dance floor.

I'm developing a fobia of clubs. When I'm in the club I feel as if I have to be cautious of every step I make so I dont get kicked out and waste time and money. It sucks as I like having a good time.

I naturally have quite a stoic face. That could be a reason. The superficial bouncers might think im aggressive or in a gang because of that.

"How do you feel about having to do first step because ""you are a man""? And what about the endless rat race for men?","Maybe im not manly enough, ive done it many times in my lifes but i still feel bad doing it. Always pushed myself to do it, it never became any easier. Most women wont ask you first, they have weird secret belief that they need to play uninterested and cold if they want to interest a man or otherwise he will see her as easy. Oh. It makes totally no sense because if man will be too eager then he will be called desperate so its totally the same thing on our side, but still we have to be the ones, always, who make the first step, or even first step**S**.

Apart from that there are things like ""he must have good job"" ""he must have well defined body"" ""he should have his own place"".

The number of women **in my age** who were **living with parents (and so did I)** were shockingly dissapointed when they discovered that I dont have my own place. This made me understand that I need to completely give up on dating before i get my own place (and if possibly then good job, car, body, etc) **but** women don't have to give up on it. They can just find a man who has his own place.

And if you assume she had well defined body then thats wrong assumption. Well built manly body with a lot of muscles is becoming a normalized thing. But try to find a woman with such body that will date you, its much harder than for them is to find a man who lifts.

I feel like all these things that women require from us (and they require more as years pass) are kind of validating them? Like we all try so hard just to get above competition and get a girlfriend that we set higher requirement bars for our other male friends, which in return do their best to also get ahead of competition, which hits us back and sets the average requirement bar even higher.

He's pretty enthusiastic and, tbh as a single full-blooded male, it's a good form of release for me. But is it cruel to do this? I tried putting myself in his position (metaphorically lol) but:

\- If I were going down on a girl and she didn't let me cum, there's no way I'd continue that kind of thing. Once or twice for the experience sure, but definitely not regularly.

\- I can't imagine any girl wanting to suck my dick with no other gain unless she was desperately in love with me.

I don't want time to keep going faster. I know there's nothing I can do about it, but I don't know how to come to terms with these feelings. I'm not even sure WHY I'm having them. It's not about what I have or haven't accomplished. It's not about where I should or shouldn't be at this point in my life. I'm just terrified of being an old man.

How to completly stop a toxic friendship that's gone on far too long ?,"Hello all,

I'm not very good at introductions and be charming in my posts. I have spoken with my friends and close people, but anyway.

I was in a psedo-gay straight relationship with my buddy who's a druggie, long story short, he steals money, I resell my games, steal stuff for him, do everything I can to help him with his ""issues' this started when I was 18 into college, oblivious of lfie and what my independent journey will be like. Now and lonely I am now 29 with a full time job, I didn't have any friends. Oddly at this point I found 2 groups, one group of my friends my age who are genuinely good people, and the other one is just..we'll call him T, the toxin.

I'm gay, I was too attracted to him not to say I like you so I ended up just telling him I liked how he loked and attacted to him, even confessed love (weird point), he was cool wtih it. Not a big deal or big subject matter at all at this point.

We've known each other for 9 years, full of toxic manipuatlive ploys in him trying to get rides and money from me trying to help him out either stop taking drugs, or to just help pay for food, just basic stuff. I thought I was being not like a savior, but just a good friend to help when when he needed. Sold my games, thought of creative idea of making money on the spot so I can hel give it to him so he can cure himself of whatever it is. Give him ride sto school to better himself, rides to work so we has something to keep himself occupied.

There was a time where I was extremely naive and truly thought my help for him was genuine and not exactly ""illegal"" It was just me having the ability to help someone else out, and I did. Turns out later it was all due to drugs, I was hurt and almost gut wretchingly broke down konwing in my heart I knew he was using me the whole timeand not the friend he claims he was to me, but the weird part is, he doesn't try to lose contact with me, it's always both of us trying to get back with each other despite horrible betrayals.

There are good days where we genuinely seem to be good friends and understand each other but I can't help but feel like it's an act so he can keep me in check, and able to ""control"" me trhough his ""needs."" He always talks abut how much money he needs but NEVER explicity asks me he needs it, he knows I'll offer it to help him, which I typically do. Because of this however, apparently I can't tell him I help him out, he'll use the excuse ""well you offer to pay for me"" evne when there are times when i lend him money he'll pay me back, not once in 9 years has he paid me a single cent. I'm not a big advocate money, it' snot a big deal, it's the principal he's been using me this way and me allowing and enabling him to do this.

I acknowledge every wrongdoing he's done and my bd enablement, but I'm finally starting to get out, I want to finally and for good get out of this bad friendship that seems so fake.

We just had an argument adn he wouldn't even listen to my reasons, I felt lke I was logical but he seemed to be angry I didn't give him what I wanted, can't ge tinto too much dteail.

It's just because I wasn't able to get what he wanted he berated me (as usual) call me names, call me lonely loser and to enjoy having fun only with my cat. I open up to him and express my feleings to him confiding in him if anything were to happen at some ponits of my life. I now realize that was a mistake divulge vulnerabilities to someone like him, he'll end up using my weakness provided to him agaisnst me , like ""fine, have fun with your loneliness and cat""

He knows I'm suicidal and doesn't seem to care at all

It's been 9 years, I love him, but I need to leave him. I don't know if this has anything to do with ask men or what not but..I finally told to STOP talking to me, you are NOT a friend. His reply: Sounds like a deal, bye.

I know he'll eventualy try to sugar coat me and coaxing me back into his friend somehow, but no, not this time. I don't want to be friends with him anymore, he's deceived me so may yers that I've become cynical and I can't trust people on a daily basis, I take anti depressants to semi-help which I'm happy to be an advocate for. No to anti-axiety tho, I try to keep away from the real dangerous ones in hopes of being responsible.

I'm typing this as I""m very sleep so I apologies if many of what I say don't correlate properly. AT the moment I do have older friends I'm trying to mend bridges with but I'm so lonely,

I feel like losing this 9 yyear worth of friendship, but I'll be very sad to lose it. I'm 27 now, should I just forget this dude, and try to make..new friends ? ( don't know how..)

I feel as if he's got a hook on me emotionally, in other words codependency.

I've been to the doctors, done meetings, went to this codependency meeting but non helps at all. I'm just feeling lonely, at a loss, I don't know what to do. It's not like I""m some bum with no job, it's just..the thought ending it all always comes to mind, because I've just become oh so cynical, but in my heart, I'v ealways viewed people as trustworthy first, and learn later.

I'm sorry if I""m not making much sense, I just wanted to put this out here and how I ended a 9 year friendshipo with a toxic friend by informing him ""You are NOT a friend, please do not EVER speak with me again"" HIs reply being: ""you got yourself a deal"" I would love to go into greater details in how badly he's screwed me over but I""ve fogiven each time..and even hel even more so..I just want real friends",AskMen,1528543093,rouenx,0,1,True,2018-06-09

How can I avoid finding men who only give selfish love and treat me like an object to captured?,"[prepare for a rant and sorry it's a little long]



A man has re-entered my life once again. He claims love is in his heart but he is moving across country, in 12 days to be exact. He says he will stay if I jump forward and claim myself as his/ spending the night with him but now has declared he is moving but wants me to experience love with him before he goes.... My heart feels for him but in my mind, this doesn't make sense!

He claimed he doesn't want a fling but he does. Who says they love you but voluntarily move and still demand you step forward and involve yourself with them??

I've been guarded with him in the past due to him wanting monogamy prior to us sleeping together(which never happened)  but then going on dates with others when my job has taken over my life (which I've warned him about). He's slept with others, gone to burning man and spanked/bdsm played with another, made me feel guilty about my health concerns (I have Crohns), has told me he can't give me compliments because I've made him guarded and yet returns to me as if I'm a unicorn to be caught. 

He knows these things would hurt him if the roles were reversed but still has done them without thinking of the person he ""loves"".

All of this....and yet I'm afraid for him to leave. I think we could have made a great couple if he wasn't so self centered and learned to think before he acted. Unfortunately both parties have dragged their feet during parts of courtship that matter. 

I stayed celibate for over a year and a half hoping he and I would work out. That maybe if I waited to just jump into the sack with him I'd build something.

This man is on Reddit, has posted about me, complains about me, talks about other women he likes  and honestly has made me want to slap him.


So after all of this, how do I wrap my head around this roller coaster and move on? How do I not let this happen again? He has made me feel like I don't even know what I'm looking for in a lover. How do I demand respect from someone who claims they are giving it but are so clueless about how they make someone actually feel?

I want love and to be loved. I'm a stable 27 (F)  who works out, is active, I'm college educated, getting my masters, have my own house, don't rely on my parents for anything, love the outdoors....   but being single (no dad figure in my life so demanding respect is never my strong suit when dating) and figuring out this muck of a dating fog sucks! On top of all this I always try to leave people better than I found them. But I'm so sick of selfish people. 

Isn't love suppose to be self-less?

I finally made out with my dreamwoman...but she has a boyfriend - how do i make her mine?,"So i am sure this Topic is the 3456 time posted. Yet i feel like i need to get this of my chest!  
Short summary: I know this girl for 8-9 years now and there was instant a connection between the two of us. I immediatly realised she is special to me (the way she talks, her views on stuff, her style.. everything). Then 7 years ago, i stayed at her place over night but me beeing afraid, stupid, overthinking stuff (dont want to lose her as a friend) - you can pick one - i did not engage on to her. After this there was a ""crack"" in our friendship and after shool ended we lost contact for a couple of years.  
Last year i heared she returned from her studies and i started texting with her. I knew she had a boyfriend for 6 years or so but i had not any bad intentions.  
After texting a couple of times and meeting once or twice it immediatly clicked and i realised i never forgot her nor will i. And she was also like the time in school... flirty, searching contact with my body etc...  
After some time she texted me, that she wants to have sex with me. I denied because she was in a relationship. 1 week after that we met, had a great time (best time so far). Later that evening she texted me - i wanted to kiss you so bad.! I still refused because of her boyfriend.  
And now yesterday i finnaly kissed her. First she liked it (the way i ""asked"" her to kiss her) and we made out. After that though she kinda freaked out.. she said this only happend because it should have happened 8 years ago, that she is not a good choice for me. Basically she felt guilty, trashtalked herself so that i dont want to pursue her. She also said that if her boyfriend is not making the next step in their relationship she might considere to end it.  
Tbh i am completly devastated. I now realise that my chances with her were 7 years ago and that there might be no 2nd chance.  
  
I know she is the one. I cant describe it any way better.. i just feel it in my guts. I know that ""she betrayed him, she will do the same to you"" arguments.. but thats a risk i am willing to take.  
I may be devastated but i wont back down. Never! How can i make her mine, what should i do now?!  
I am sorry that it is such a long post but i hope anyone can help me a little bit.  
  
TL;DR - I finnaly made out with my dreamwoman who has is in a realtionship. I want her though. What should i do?

How would you prefer a complete stranger (F) to ask you out if they're just interested in a casual relationship?,"No assumptions about whether or not you're interested or available; I'd like to know how you would feel in any case.

My instinct is to say something like, ""Hey, I'm sorry to bother you when you're just going about your business/trying to work out/etc., but you're extremely attractive. Are you single?"" Because if it were me, I would *always* prefer (regardless of whether or not I found him attractive/was interested in him) that a stranger asking me out would say something that makes it clear that he recognizes that I'm a human being with a mind and a life and that I might not appreciate being asked out out of nowhere, even if we were *both* interested in having sex with each other. 

But my male friend says that's too much hedging and a guy would rather I just get to the point. He says it's better to just walk up and say ""Hey, I think you're really hot. Can I have your number?"" To me, that's too abrupt, and if a guy asked that, I would be a lot more uncomfortable because it's difficult to reject politely.

We were never close to begin with, but a year after graduating college I started making an effort to get closer to him.

How can i fuck with a couple of strangers trying to get me into a pyramid scheme?,"Basically, a few months ago I was shopping for some clothes when a guy came up and just started chatting about the store etc. He asked a few light personal questions and said how he recently started working in the area and took my information just in case something popped up. 


It was a little weird at the time but he wasn‚Äôt too forward and kinda just gave me a funny look when i asked if he was gonna pitch me a pyramid scheme. I didn‚Äôt think much of it but i was skeptical with a hint of optimism. 

This past week he texted me about chatting and meeting up because there are some positions available and he‚Äôd like to get to know me. I had the same feelings as before, skeptical, kind of optimistic, but mostly very curious, so I decided to meet with him for coffee yesterday. 

Hours before he surprises me by saying his wife is going to be there due to ‚Äúreasons‚Äù and my alarms start to go off. Either he wants me to fuck his wife or this is some sort of scam. I was hoping for the former. 

When i get there and start talking with them, it‚Äôs obvious that the wife came on purpose and that they were trying to get me involved in a pitch. All of the talk was vague about entrepreneurship, and trying to reach a higher standard of living (trying to take advantage of people who dream of being rich as fuck). They gave me a book to read and we are planning to meet up again next week. 

Now i‚Äôve been to MLM pitches before for shits and giggles (smoking with other skeptical friends beforehand helps - truly an experience), and they mostly use a shotgun effect to try to rope in a bunch of people as fast as possible, so I was just very confused with this couple and their goal. After some light research it‚Äôs obvious that it‚Äôs a scam (amway afaik). 

After finding this out, I was a little annoyed but I‚Äôm excited for the opportunity to fuck with them, but I could use some ideas. I was thinking to have them meet me somewhere an hour away and just ghost them but i‚Äôm sure i can  do better ",AskMen,1525965997,nomilkinmybonez,56,150,True,2018-05-10

What is the best way to build confidence?,"**The Backstory.** 

I recently broke up with my very first girlfriend of 6 months. We broke up because I graduated and was moving back home to NY while she still had another year left of college. I don't have a car, so logistically we felt that it wasn't worth staying together.

I met her tinder, which I've never had any luck on. Luckily she messaged me first and after a bit of talking we start to hung out one day and cuddled in her bed. The next time I saw her we had sex. After having sex for a while we started dating.

**The Problem**

Since the break up I have tried to get back into the dating. I downloaded Tinder and Bumble to try to meet some women, but I find my self in the same situation I was before I got my girlfriend. After 6 months of dating, I still don't know how to talk to women. In the past I could just brush this off, but now I can't. 

See my girlfriend has a high sex drive and being with her made me realize I also had a high sex drive. I guess I should have known by the amount that I masturbated, usually once or twice a day. But now that I've had a consistent sex life, I want the real thing and not my hand.

When asking my ex for advice she said the main thing that I should work on is my confidence. She said that that is the main difference between me and the guys that she sleeps with. She swears that I am attractive enough to get women, and often commented on how surprised she was that I haven't had many sexual partners (3 including her).

**The Question**

How does one gain confidence, in particularly self confidence? I lack confidence in my ability with women since I've never succeeded with them, but after doing some research I found that using validation to fuel your confidence does not work. I'm also a naturally shy/not talkative person and thus suck at holding a conversation, something that my ex complained about throughout our relationship. Although I did get better in these regards during our relationship, I know that I am below average and need to improve.",AskMen,1525968884,10blast,12,4,True,2018-05-10

There was a sharp turn on a divided highway along the way to the game and there was a jeep in front of me. I thought he went and I stomped the gas because I had a small window, and it turned out, he didn‚Äôt. I rear ended him probably doing about 15. He pulled out after that and just kept going and I figured ‚Äúwell shit, is this guy ever gonna stop?‚Äù. He did. He pulled into the away team gym, the one I was heading to. I parked as close as I could to him, hopped out, and ran over to see if there was any damage. It was one of the parents dropping off his daughter. There was a dent about the size of a fist in the left side of his rear bumper and he says ‚Äúyou didnt get any paint. That‚Äôs what a bumper‚Äôs there for. As long as no one‚Äôs hurt, im happy‚Äù.

How socially acceptable is it for men to call other men's girlfriends hot/comment on their bodies?,"I have never ever ever considered myself attractive. Ever. When I was 7 someone called me ""Fat Andi"" (I looked identical to a girl in my class named Andi) and it stuck. So 12 years and an eating disorder later, I have absolutely terrible self-image. Around my friends I offhandedly call myself fat and ugly, not as a ""fishing"" thing but because I've felt that way for so long I feel silly not acknowledging it. I do not get hit on by men EVER. 

My best friend (we'll call her Sarah) of 2 years is in my honest opinion one of the most attractive people I know. She gets hit on all the time, she is extremely confident, she's really thin and dresses extremely well, and has an amazing butt. The first and last time someone hit on me was when my now-boyfriend started flirting with me about 10 months ago. One time I drunkenly mentioned how much more attractive than myself I found Sarah to my BF, and he looked at me funny and said something along the lines of ""completely objectively, 99% of the world would find you more attractive.""

I completely wrote it off until like last week, when I was at a party. My BF and the hosts (two guys. We will call one of them George, Sarah has a big thing for him) were on the porch. I don't think they knew the window was open, but they were very drunkenly telling my BF that he was dating ""the super fucking hot one"" of my friend group. My BF was trying to set up Sarah and George, but George was like ""I don't know, I don't think she's that cute. PlasticBoysenberry is way hotter."" It was extremely bizarre. He also has told me that one of his housemates has commented on the size of my chest a couple of times. 

This isn't a ""who do you think is hotter, me or my friend"" question, this is ""is this something you would say to your friends about their gfs""? I feel like this was weird and there was some ulterior motive for them to say this. I don't know if it should make me uncomfortable or not, but it isn't something me and my friends would say, and i don't know if I should ask my bf to tell his friends to lay off or to just make sure I'm out of earshot next time.

How do I set up a healthy schedule?,"Hello. 
I'm a 18 year old boy who's just put on a lot of weight in the past few months due to my examinations. I'm 5'5 and weigh 187 lbs. 
I used to be a regular squash and badminton player and that used to help keep my weight in check, however due to my exams, I've been unable to get out of the house everyday and thus, have put on the pounds. 
And it doesn't help that my mom doesn't consider this an issue, and despite my protests, always make tasty food which I end up gobling up. 
However this weight gain is affecting my personal life as I feel extremely insecure almost 24/7. I've stopped wearing fitting clothes and have resorted to extremely loose clothes which I don't like wearing. 

My question is, is there any way for me to control my weight gain in these circumstances, especially since my outdoor activities are restricted for the next two months atleast? I mean it would really be nice to fit into my fav pair of jeans :)

"How does one go about learning to be themselves, when being yourself is possibly literally illegal?","This is something I've struggled with for a long time. There's a strong desire in me to go out, have fun,  be fearless, by myself, etc. On some level, I think it would a positive, and necessary change in my life. The problem is I feel like it's simply not allowed by society.

I've heard every 'just go out and do it' motivation thing you'd ever hear, and it feels like it would be so much easier if I were a different person. Okay, suppose I want to go out to a club or bar, and come out of my shell; throw off the me that would have just shyly drank a drink or two, talked with the guy next to me about some random shit, and eyed some girl over there. They say there's an outgoing person inside for those who only have the confidence and courage to show it, and fair enough, I've always known that was the case, but that final hurdle is that I simply feel like I'm going to get into trouble for it. In our post-woke era, for example, any touch I'm bold enough to go for is simply sexual assault. I can't be spontaneous and put my arm around someone, or whatever else a free, just-having-fun-and-being-impulsive me would want to do. It's difficult, because the same lack of willingness to dare to be in the moment that has prevented so much potential good in my life, could also lead to something bad. Do I just have to accept the bad with the good? Do I simply have to risk getting in trouble as the price of being who I am? 

I know the canned answer that 'we have social interaction all figured out with nice safe rules' people would give, and if it isn't already clear, I fucking hate those people. They're lame, not to mention idiots if they think they can actually accomplish that. ""Yes you can have fun as long as you respect yada yada yada, and basically accept living in this world full of boring pussies who like things safe and dull."" Well, I don't like things like that. I want to go to a club where people are doing drugs in the bathroom and fights break out every night. I don't mind living in a world where someone might drunkenly grab my ass while I'm out one night, even if it's another guy. It's not a big deal, in fact it's literally happened, and it was just part of 'things that happen when you're out on a Saturday' kind of thing to me, perhaps in the world I would prefer, not even something worthy of note.

I remember back when, in my college dorm on a very safe space-y state campus, when we had an 'incident' where a drunk guy went down the hall knocking on doors and making random comments. My roommate agreed with me, it was just kinda funny, part of college life, and hardly a big deal. But the RA gave out forms and had people write about their feelings of this 'incident', so we could cope with our experience or whatever. OMFG, was that insanity to me. Seems even more so today. But it feels like those people have won, and now we all have to live by those absurd, restrictive rules about life and not stepping on any toes or hurting feelings or whatever else.

Going beyond leisure time, another aspect of this is finally putting out some artistic ideas into the world that I've had forever. Problem is, I think it's pretty much 100% that I would have to insulate myself from having those things linked to me under my real name, because otherwise it would ruin my life and render me unemployable. Heck, even voicing some of my personal opinions aloud on the internet is dangerous on some level. I think that's bullshit, and under other anonymous reddit accounts, I voice my opinion that it's bullshit. But the fact remains we live in this world where you have to be really careful about such things.

So, I remain in some sort of holding pattern. A cowardly one, I sometimes think. Perhaps it's not unreasonable to have some sort of consideration of consequences, but it affects my life in a myriad of ways, not isolated to just these few things. On some level, you have to just suck it up, get off your as, and go do, but for me that seems to invariably involve negative consequences, and I'm not sure what to do about that.

How private do you keep your relationship?,"Just trying to get the male perspective here. I'm currently in a 4.5 year relationship with a guy who is very very very private. I was basically unknown to his family until a few months ago, and he said it's because he didn't really want his parents to ask about this and that (traditional Asian family, and yes they can be quite strict). He basically thinks the relationship is between us, and there is no need to basically tell the world (although he would mention having a gf, just not actively tell people about me).

I'm just wondering if anyone of you are like that too - preferring not to post photos or anything on social media, would tell your friends about your gf but not bring her to meet them etc.

Before this, I honestly thought everyone would want to tell people how happy they are in a relationship and all. But obviously this doesn't apply here. Is this a guy thing, or maybe just some guys are like that?

How did you 'get your shit together'?,"I'm just looking for experience, strength, hope. I wish I could just Google this but I learn a lot more from genuine reddit replies. I think a lot of men struggle with this process and it would mean a lot to me and to those other dudes if you could share about your journey and some helpful hints. 

I'm 28 and have been through a lot in my life. I spent most of my 20's smoking weed, drinking to escape things I didn't want to feel and fucking up in different ways year after year. Somehow I have learned enough about design, development, marketing, sales to have consistent work and a growing professional network. I am a joke to my extended family, it's a miracle that my immediate family loves me enough to have given me a third chance. I'm grateful that I am at least decently good looking that women notice me but I still have a lot to work on before any sane and attractive woman would want to be in a relationship with me.

**Where I'm at today:** I haven't smoked or drank in over 10 months. I've gotten out of $16k of debt, started saving and investing. I've built an agency that allows me to do what I'm good at while earning money, I have completed a few projects, gotten a few referrals, opened some doors for to get some bigger gigs/projects in Q2 of this year. I've lost 10 lbs, started building a toned body again. I've quit all meat except fish and eggs, all sweets, soft drinks, and processed foods except on rare occasions. I've started dating for the first time in the last few years after getting caught up with a girl who BPD (story for another time), just getting over my fears and getting my feet wet. I've grown closer to my immediate family and we have forgiven each other and started to enjoy each other's company again. 

**Where I would like to be:** Build my agency to a point where I can travel and work remotely at the same time, settle in cities I like for a month or two before moving on. I'd like to be at ~13% body fat, at ~20% now, was at ~25% a year ago. In a fulfilling relationship with a woman on a similar journey as me and able to accept my past. Even more comfortable living a sober life and able to be a good son, brother, and uncle. Able to help others like I have been helped by mentors, by reddit, by strangers without a thought of getting something out of it.

How do you stop caring about finding a relationship?,"I already know the generic advice and yes I keep busy and work hard to improve myself and ""enjoy"" being a single young woman (I'm 20). I work 8-4 and my evenings are filled with volunteering, church and church activities, and salsa classes. My friday nights are usually spent with my girlfriends and then my Saturdays I spend doing errands and cooking (which I love to do). I workout about 4 times a week and would consider myself to be in good shape. I also study French every single day because it's my dream to become fluent one day (my francophone friends said I speak French, not perfectly but I have a good knowledge!). 

Anyways, despite keeping this busy, I crave touch and intimacy. I hate to admit it but I feel lonely. I only sleep about 5 hours a night (excluding weekends) and I always wish that I had someone I could share my bed with, someone I can rant to, someone I can cuddle, someone I can count on. 

My work office is 80% middle aged women, my church is about 65% girls, where I volunteer only has girls, and my salsa class only has middle aged people. I don't have time to add another weekly activity and I'm already struggling to create real connections with the people in these activities. I've made lots of acquaintances so far, but haven't established deep connections yet. My family is far from here as well. 

I'm currently using dating apps and it's exhausting. I dated someone for a month and thought it was going somewhere but I scared him off because he said that I was looking for something too serious while he isn't. 

Am I normal for having this craving? The people in my life told me I need to stop trying to find relationships so I've tried to keep busy but it doesn't seem to get rid of this yearning. 

Not sure what exactly I'm looking for on this thread. Any advice? Anyone share similar sentiments? ",AskMen,1520736968,vaginaprobs_,42,71,True,2018-03-10

Is responsible, has money and a good job.
A car and a motorcycle which he uses in the summer.
Got this swagger around him self and is a total nerd and so was the girl he was talking too. He is not overweight or underweight. 

He went on a blind date set up by our female friend, they hit it off because I saw him texting her and she him when I went to the gym with him.

They were supposed to go too another date yesterday if she did not need to work late. I sent him a text asking him how it went and he did not reply. I asked him again and then called him and he says he did not want to talk about it and I left it there.

This guy has been thrown a lot of shit in his life and I just want to help.
He has been rejected many times before and even been called ugly because of his height. (granted the girl who called him that was not a looker her self)

He is not ugly I think, he grooms well and is not deformed or any close to what I would call unattractive. 

I know I am assuming its his height because I heard from him after the first date that she was weirded out by the height difference.

I just want to help him. :(

We‚Äôve been apart for about 6 months, in those 6 months I‚Äôve lost 75 pounds, bought a new car, got a promotion at work and have been handling life quite well while bouncing two small children between the two of us and work schedules. 


What now? I‚Äôm so prepared for a Marriage or a relationship, I‚Äôve spent time in therapy, I‚Äôve spent time self evaluating and maturing during these 6 months of self realization and acceptance, I‚Äôve had a lot to work on, I‚Äôm not perfect and the recent divorce has left me yearning for Affection and companionship. I have a Cat, a best friend and an avid social life when I‚Äôm not working 45+ hours a week or at home with my Children. I‚Äôm still working on my issues, plus the ones I‚Äôve gained from the recent divorce..

When is it time to start dating again? I‚Äôve been on a couple dates, not had sex with anyone since my Ex Wife, But have found interest in a couple women, is it too early?  Other men who have been divorced, 3-5 years out of the Divorce, how are you feeling? Is it just different for every person?

I like puzzles, Sudoku etc, but those have a pattern. Figure out the pattern and they all become the same thing, the puzzle loses it's mystery.

What can i do to avoid falling for a scam?,"Long post ahead.

Hey guys,

Basically, I know that I'm super dumb for trusting a stranger to deliver on his promise but I thought that most people are great and wouldn't scam another person over their hard earned money, but I was wrong. I had always heard of those craigslist scams but I thought that they were very rare.

 So me, having saved up $200( a lot for me) decided that I wanted a nintendo switch even though I knew they were around 300 but I heard that local marketplaces like Offerup and Craigslist sold stuff cheap so I decided to look around. I eventually found a deal from Pennsylvania (I live in TX) of a guy selling a switch with 5 games for ONLY $200. I was pretty happy that it was so cheap but I did get a little bit suspicious.

 I contact the guy and he offers to ship it but he wants me to pay via Paypal which is fine with me. Except he wants me to do it with friends and family so I would have no protection. I told him that it was kind of risky so I told him to do an invoice but he told me the reason is that he really needs the money and doesn't want to wait the 21 days. I still had faith in the notion that most humans are great people so I went along with it and I send the money. He tells me he will ship it tommorow (this was on a sunday) and I wait. He tells me on monday that he shipped it and I should get it on friday. 

Come thursday night, I ask him if it'll be here tommorow and he says to give me his paypal. I said I thought he already shipped it. He then tells me to suck a dick and blocks my contact. Friday morning currently and I feel terrible knowing how dumb I acted. 

So now the question: how can i not fall for a scam like this again?

Excuse my grammar.

TLDR - Guy i met on craigslist offered a switch for 200 and he scammed me with me not being able to get a refund because I did friends and family on paypal.

We've talked about this since we broke up and don't know what the answer is. It's hard to come home to your partner at night and live in that reality with them.

"Guys, how do you deal with burnout on the job?","Hello Askmen, How have you guys dealt with burnout?  I've tried switching jobs, eating better, exercising, sleeping regularly, and talking to my doctor about depression.  I have fun (to me) hobbies and I'm fine outside of work.  If I take a vacation, I'm super relaxed at the end of it but within a few hours of getting back into work I just can't take it anymore.

Originally, I thought it was related to the soul crushing nature of my gig that I had for more than a decade at a large multinational company (constant layoffs every 6 months or so for most of the time there, pointless bureaucracy, petty politics).  So I decided to switch it up and I found a job at a small local company.  I lasted three years before I left (we'd lost like 2/3 of the team and another guy was leaving but the boss was just like ""suck it up guys"").  I switched to another small company, but this one was focused so all the people basically worked on the same thing. During my probationary period things were great.  Literally the day after, when we all decided I would stay, they changed my job to something else which  was not something I had ever done before and would have never agreed to do (if only there was some sort of trial period or something...).  Out of nowhere I got a call from a previous coworker about a job for another (different, smaller) multinational company.  I like the job itself but, wow... the petty politics.  Unfortunately, the politics aren't ""office politics"" they are ""director politics"" so whole reporting chains are affected.  My project which was supposed to take 7 quarters to finish, was suddenly cut to 4 quarters (in the 4th quarter) and people are ""wondering"" why we can't finish (um, you literally told us halfway through that time's up... no period of time to try to finish, go figure).  I guess my 2nd or 3rd line pissed someone off so they ""called"" the project due to get egg on his face.  Oh and now there's a money pinch and there are going to be layoffs.

I'm in my early-mid 40s, I have two jobs (second multinational and very part time at the second small company) because if I lose the full time job at least I'll have something.  I'm getting to the point in my life where health insurance is vital (middle age) and live in the US so switching to some other career like underwater basket weaving for fun isn't really an option.

Any ideas or suggestions?  What have you done that seemed to work?

How did you start/finish a project that you were procrastinating over for ages?,"Have you procrastinated over something really important that is essential to your success? How did you end up getting started with it and doing well at it?

I'm supposed to write the GMAT to get into a college, but can't get myself to study for it. I absolutely despise studying for exams, but really want to get a master's degree and so this is incredibly important for me. Been procrastinating over it for almost a year, and I haven't gotten shit done. Quit my job just to study for this, as I am terrible at multi-tasking and know I wouldn't be able to work and study at the same time, but even now I just sit with the books open, stare at them and waste my time. I've gone off social-media, put my phone away to cut down on distractions, done everything I can think of that is stopping me from actually studying, but nothing has helped. It's driving me nuts. If I try to get myself to study, I just get a headache and cannot focus.

I even booked the exam once, because I thought if I had a deadline I would actually study out of fear, but that deadline came and went and I didn't study shit. I actually attempted the exam without studying for it at all, and blew up like $250. How do I fix this mess? I just really want to get studying.

"My friend saw a girl for 2 months but they separated about a month ago. She wants to ""hangout"" with me now. What do I do??","So they were never ""official"" and they ended mutually. He seemed pretty upset about it when it happened but she said that he prompted it. 

Obviously my gut move is that seeing her would be 10/10 violating any bro/ friendship rules but she's insisting that they ended mutually after discussion. 

I'm super torn on what to do. I told her that I may be risking a friendship and she claims that nobody even has to know. I need some outside external motivation for what I should do.

Update: i posted most of this in a comment below, but I'll post it here too so it's easier to find. 
She has said I should just ask him since the time I posted this. Now I'm not sure what her intentions are, but it may still be to cause a rift between my friend and I by even creating this predicament.

I'm going to let him know the situation tonight and get his opinion. I still may do nothing with her even if he says its alright, given the sort of history he had with her; albeit short.

"Hook up guy gave money after sex, when is this not offensive?","Asking for a friend. 
My friend [F32] has this hook up guy for a few months now. They would meet up every time he's in the country for business. They rarely talk/text in between and guy would just contact her to let her know he's in.
Anyway, they met Christmas night for a hook up, the guy is staying at a friends apartment so he checked in at a hotel so they can meet and when my friend got home, she told me the guy handed her $100 as a ""christmas gift""  and she doesn't know if she should be offended or just enjoy the money.
Oh and she mentioned that she thinks the guy is dating someone but not serious yet. 
What do you make of this? Is this offensive? 

Edit: My title should have been ""Is it offensive when a hook up gives money after sex?"" however it keeps getting deleted.  It's what I'm really asking rather than made a conclusion that IT IS offensive. As for me, i find it somewhat uncomfortable but just because i'm sensitive when it comes to money. As for my friend (yes it really happened to my friend) she just doesn't know what to make of it. ",AskMen,1514263151,bookislife,27,10,True,2017-12-25

How do I convince myself I'm good enough for a SO?,"Hi Askmen, this may sound like a pathetic, needy question but I'm at a loss at this point.

I'm 25 years old, never had a relationship or sex. I'm reasonably confident/forthright in most other avenues of my life. But when it comes to girls I really like and have a fondness for, I'm a pathetic coward. It doesnt matter how well things are going, or even if a girl is into me. There is an evil, Insecure voice in my head that convinces me every time I'm not good enough for that person, even if they wanted me to make a move and I find out later they were interested. But ended up with someone else.

Maybe I still have work to do on myself, but I really don't want to feel unworthy of having someone anymore.

Edit: 

I don't have a SO, I'm speaking hypothetically 

One person noted i should not be calling myself a pathetic coward, so i take this bit back

Physically, the only things i haven't done is oral sex and actual intercourse, to paint a better picture that there has been occurrences, but I'm getting in my own way/not keeping my confidence up 

Thanks for all the answers and support.

What is the proper etiquette for getting cut out of a will?,"I know it might sound like such an entitled, rude question (especially considering the person is still alive), but I feel incredibly hurt and I don't really know who to talk about this with.

The backstory is that my birth father passed away before I was born and for all of my childhood life my mother was living with and eventually married to my step-father (never adopted, just have always used the term). It wasn't a perfect marriage or relationship by any means and we moved in and out quite a few times but he was the only father figure in my life for 18 years. He also has one other son that was about 13 years older than me, with four kids of his own, but he passed away last year. Him and my mom are no longer together but are both on good terms.

Anyway, going home for the holidays and visiting with everybody, unfortunately both him and my mother are getting older and the uncomfortable but necessary conversation of wills came up. My stepfather owns a large chunk of land that is one-half of a larger chunk of land that was split between him and his two brothers but one sold to the other two as well as owning a home and some land. I guess what it is really doesn't matter because the long and short of it is that I found out that I am not in the will for anything. I never have been. Everything was going to go to his birth son and now everything is going to his grandchildren.

I don't know how I should feel about this. My first reaction is honestly how this is symbolic of me feeling like his child to an extent and that this obviously isn't the case any more. Then there IS the entitlement part in that I was worked to tears over the years with logging that land and the upkeep of the area (lots of livestock and woods) so it just kind of shocks me that I'm being cut out especially considering his birth son NEVER helped out (he lived with his mother except for visiting one weekend a month). I can't even actually say that I was cut out, I was never even cut in. I honestly have no clue what the various lands in his estate is worth, but I could see it being in the high-six or low seven-figures range. So, yeah, that part kind of miffs me too. It's kind of hard to separate what feelings are from hurting emotionally and what feelings are from greed. I don't know if that makes me terrible, but I feel kind of terrible.

Do I have any right to feel this way?

What's your thoughts on Martial Arts and how it can be used to face life's challenges?,"Hi all -- not sure if there's any martial artists on this forum. Hoping to get some advice in this area.

I'm generally a very happy, level-headed person that's introverted and that has alot of discipline. But over the years, my personality type has always been subject to intimidation from others. I'm 30, and growing up, I've been bullied alot within schoolyards and households. As I grow older, I've also been subject to other forms of intimidation in the corporate world, as well as political environments.

The reality is that I'm very bad at confronting people; I have a sense of anxiety and fear welling up inside when I'm against someone with a bigger power distance. I did a couple of self-assessment tests like MBTI, DiSC or other psychological assessments, and I consistently err on someone who is ""amiable"" as a strength.

Its not necessarily a critical flaw in getting through life -- I'm in good financial standing, with a good social network and a girlfriend that I have a wonderful relationship with. But I realized if I wanted to take on bigger goals in the next decade like going in to leadership positions and volunteering within the community to help marginalized people, I need to be sure of myself and kinda find that inner strength to constructively defuse a situation. Also stop taking advantaged of by people as well. On a side note, I also want to be physically active and join a community as well, though these are not necessarily the main reasons. They just intersect nicely with this idea.

I'm wondering if anyone on this forum can speak from experience and see if this is something worth trying? Almost all of these situations are non-violent, but confrontational and involve some form of power struggle. Since martial arts was meant to focus energy and train in combat situations, I'm unsure if it would apply, but would appreciate your insights.

Thank you.",AskMen,1512996532,AT1787,15,3,True,2017-12-11

"Signs of interest from girls I find attractive make it harder for me to approach them, how do I overcome it ?","Hi. Didn't know what to put in the title so hopefully this is clear enough. What I mean is that most of the time I can see that a girl is interested in me (which is not that often), if too much time passes between this and the moment I try to talk to her, I tend to feel some kind of pressure, like I think that she may have been fantasizing about myself, and that the real mundane kinda dull me won't live up to those expectations. It sound illogical, but it happened to me before, and is happening right now with a girl.

Did it ever happen to you ? how do you overcome it ?

"Men, what steps do I take in order to become the man I know I can be?","This question has been heavy on my mind for quite some time. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a 21 year old guy that longs for the life I know I can create for myself. I truly envision a great and successful future for myself, but I struggle with a lot of personal issues that I have a hard time breaking away from. I'm addicted to porn and masturbating, I'm lazy and procrastinate over the smallest things, like folding my laundry or washing dirty dishes. I seem incapable of following a strict workout or diet plan without allowing laziness to break me at some point and revert back to my regular ways. I seek validation for my self worth from women, and literally allow those women to dictate my moods daily (what I mean by this, is I won't feel 'good' about myself until women in my life start talking and interacting with me). I overthink everything when it comes to social situations, especially with women. I seem to get too attached to women that show me the slightest bit of attention. A girl could say hello to me and smile, and I'll immediately assume she's into me and wants to get together. I'm a mess, really. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want better for myself. I know I have great potential, and I'm sitting on a mountain of knowledge on how to reach the different aspects of life I'd like to achieve, but I never seem to be able to start, and whenever I do find the ridiculous amount of effort it seems to take in order to start, all it takes is one bad day, and I'm broken and converting back to all the bad habits I've created.

How can I go out and meet new people? I've been single for a few months and I've been on and off with a couple girls but I'd like to just go out and experience more. I've tried staying away from tinder for personal reasons and I just don't know many girls outside of Facebook and whatnot. I'm 22 but I don't drink at all really so I'd rather not just sit in a bar all night. Plus the bars around here aren't really meant for people my age unless they are throwing an event or something.

But that's just me. I have a friend who considers it better to lie passively in order to protect relationships, etc. Basically, the truth is relative and much more a means to an end than an ideal.

How can I help my boyfriend to realize he needs fruits/vegetables in his diet?,"We have been together for 2 years now. I have always eaten very healthy. He on the other hand, doesn't at all. His daily meals consist of nothing for breakfast, a very small chicken sandwich for lunch, nothing for dinner, then about 11pm before laying down, he wants peanut butter, banana, and Nutella sandwich. If not a banana sandwich, he'll make a tostitos microwave pizza. I love him with all of my heart and I want I'm to be healthy, but he just will not change his diet for his own health. I'll also add that he's always nauseous in the mornings, hence him not eating breakfast ever. He throws up almost every morning and he has medication for it ,but refuses to take it, so the vomiting continues.

I just want him to eat any kind of vegetable. All he ever eats is processed sugary junk or greasy fast food/ convenience meals.

I've thought about openly talking about this issue with him, but I already know his feelings would be so hurt and he would question whether I'm attracted to him at all. He might even become angry at me for bringing up something to do with his appearance. I've hinted on the subject, but he seems alittle defensive everytime I do hint at eating healthier.

Let me preface this by saying this isn't a typical ""How do I get girls to like me???"" question. I'm traditionally attractive, muscular, etc, and don't really have a problem finding an attractive girl.

In fact, I met an attractive girl recently. I DM'd her on Instagram and set up a date for next Saturday. She seems interested in me and gave me her snapchat and phone number; she expects me to message her soon.

My problem... especially over snapchat, I can't keep a conversation. It's not like I'm a stuttering idiot or nervous... I just don't know what to say. I don't want to ask questions interview-style; I want a naturally-flowing conversation. I've had MANY past experiences where the girl simply loses interest in me because I'm boring.

"Do you have any tips for maintaining a happy, serious relationship with someone who smokes when you are not a smoker?","I'll share my story and clarify some things before we get into it because I know the most common answer is: ""if you don't like it, don't date someone who does it.""

I'm 29, she's 28. I've known my current SO for about 13 years, but we've only been in a relationship for a year now (though we dated for a few months when we were teens, 13 years ago). I knew she was a smoker when we started dating, and she had been smoking for 10 years at that point. I had never dated a smoker before, so it's not something I knew I wasn't going to like. At the time in my life, I spent a lot of time in a smokey bar surrounded by friends who smoke and generally didn't mind it.

A year later, it's starting to bother me a lot. Not just her...but being around smoking at all. The other night we were at that same smokey bar I used to spend many hours in, surrounded by her and 3 other friends who all smoke. I couldn't stand it. I had to go sit at a different table. I generally don't like hanging out at that bar anymore and haven't for a while, but you know some times you have to go somewhere you don't want to because your friends and SO do want to go there...it's just part of the give-and-take.

We live together now and for at least 6 months (or more) she's been telling me she's going to quit. *I have never asked her to quit smoking.* This was something she brought up on her own. She has known I do not like it. I have made it clear that it's been bothering me a lot. 

Making decisions like continuing the relationship, moving in together, etc, have been based on her frequently talking about quitting. Perhaps it was naive of me to base life decisions on something like that.

A couple weeks ago I asked her ""Are you serious about quitting?"" and she said ""Yes; I wouldn't lie to you.""

She has cut back a lot. She was a pack-a-day smoker and she says she's down to a pack every 3 days but I think it's really a pack every other day. I'm very proud of her cutting back and I've told her many times. 

Yesterday I brought up her smoking bothering me again and it felt like she hinted at she really has no desire to quit. She said ""I really enjoy it."" and she also said ""A middle of the road would be switching to vaping."" She bought a vape quite a few months ago, months after she first started talking about quitting, but she doesn't use it. It seems like she always has an excuse not to use it.

I can't promise that'll solve the problem for me but I do think it would help *a lot*, if not entirely solve it.

She seems to currently not be interested in having kids, and I could go either way. She's hinted recently (while drinking) that in the future she would be interested in having kids with me. After thinking about it a lot and assessing my feelings, I know that I do not want to have any kids with a smoker. I don't want my kids around that.

I am also an ex-smoker years ago, but was never more than a pack a week smoker. I wasn't super into it but did it off and on for years, mostly just while out drinking with friends, plus one on my drive home after work every day. 

I think that's really everything...

I love her a lot and I just want us to be happy together.

What am I doing wrong when approaching and garnering interest from women?,"So I'm feeling a huge amount of regret with my college experience, now that I've realized there's this other facet of the college experience that I missed out on (dating girls, hooking up with them, etc.). Realizing this as I enter my second last year of college kinda makes me sad about never paying attention to this area of my life.

I approach in classes or free fitness classes at the gym, or I try online. Online rarely works, I rarely get matches or if I do, they are bots or flake. Classes, I approach the girls after class. They will be uninterested or taken. After a yoga class, people will just leave and not talk to others. Same with hash runs and social partner dances. Or the girls there will be taken. I've approached many women, but they either aren't interested or are taken. I will make some comment about the class and laugh and then ask some questions like name, major, any club/sorority/involvement she is in. I don't know how to up my flirting game and bring them to my place for making out and having sex. I might make some joke involving their name .""will hurricane [name] be just as bad as hurricane Irma"" or ""Working hard or hardly working""?

PUA also advocates approaching 100+ women. How WOULD I meet that many women? I CAN cold approach but am not sure how would I get a number/date from a random approach, which is NOT in a bar/mixer/party/class. Making small chat with a stranger/waitress is much different than asking her out on a date. 

I am in some clubs on campus
I am in a coed frat.
I go to free fitness class like pilates or yoga and I am the only dude (or one of 2 guys there)

"On a scale of ""would sell own mother into slavery for a cheeseburger"" to ""no man nor god could tempt you away from your loved ones"", how generally loyal are you?","I ask this because I realized when thinking about my life last week that I would have no compunction with dropping everything I am currently tied to if it meant I could have a totally free life (not free monetarily, free as in I'd be self-employed and self-sufficient; my freelance work can be done anywhere there's an Internet connection, so if I didn't mind living in the middle of nowhere, I could move to some ghost town in the Rust Belt or in the parts of the Pacific Northwest where all the logging jobs are gone and apartments can be had for under $500 for what I pay over a grand for in the Seattle suburbs.)

I have almost no loyalties that people can bank on unless they're willing to come with me when I go (and my girlfriend and I have actually discussed that very possibility.) I'm loyal, ultimately, only to myself and, as a religious man, the gods.

Meanwhile, my brother's a company man, lives close to his parents (but not with them; the guy makes six figures), his values are all about his marriage (14 years this week), his kids (9 and 7), his job, all the old-school American Dream stuff, real Norman Rockwell shit.  He's my polar opposite in that sense.

Overweight guys who attempted to date what were your experiences and difficulties you had to overcome?,"Sorry I didn‚Äôt mean to make a yes or no thread I‚Äôve amended the title. I‚Äôm just seeking personal experiences from overweight guys that attempted to date and how it went for them 


I haven‚Äôt had a full on serious relationship before but I‚Äôve had a few girlfriends where we never lived together or anything in my time; I had my last one end earlier this year which was the closest thing to a serious relationship I‚Äôve had and it took me a while to move on from it but all of these women I‚Äôve been with I just ended up meeting out and about in social gathering situations, became friends and things happened so I‚Äôve never gone through any online dating and I‚Äôve certainly been less active in my personal life as I approached and then reached 30 than I was in my late teens and early 20‚Äôs but I do feel like I‚Äôve gone long enough that I want to meet someone new but now that my friends have all drifted off in to different phases of life I‚Äôm finding my opportunities to get out and about and meet new people are limited.




I‚Äôm a bigger dude so I did some googling to find any advice on how I should approach the online scene and almost everything was directed at advice for women which really isn‚Äôt applicable to me. This whole scene is entirely new to me and being larger probably makes it even more delicate. 




Before anyone says ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù I‚Äôve already lost about 15-18kgs this year (give or take daily fluctuations) so I‚Äôm already doing my thing and flipped my lifestyle upside down to much more healthier eating; so is it something I should put in a profile and disclaimer that I‚Äôm physically active and actively losing weight or anything like that or should I just not bother until I‚Äôm at an acceptable body type? Is it really just a matter of taking true and realistic photos and just seeing what sticks? I live in Sydney, Australia if that makes some kind of difference.



Disclaimer: not a sympathy post, not a whinge post, I‚Äôm not a woe is me person I‚Äôm just genuinely seeking advice and personal experiences from guys in my situation who succeeded or even failed or just men overall who have any insight they can share.",AskMen,1509096521,Anunnaki-87,163,169,True,2017-10-27

At what point in the dating process do you bail when physical intimacy is absent?,"I ask because everything else seems great. We have been talking and occasionally going on dates for months. We both have hectic schedules, hers more so than mine. The problem is nothing physical is happening. I don't believe she is intentionally avoiding going out with me more often. I'd assume we wouldn't meet up then at all if that was the case. I'm in my 30s and she's in her late 20s. I continue to ask her out and she assures me that she of course wants to go out with me and see me more. I'm continuing on based on really liking her a lot. She's a breeze to talk to and be around. We can chat for hours and burn an entire night away without realizing 5 hours has passed. But again, I'm not sure where things are headed as far as the physical part goes. I've tried to get closer, but she seems distant and probably just really shy to appear physically interested in me. To make matters harder, she's not constantly attached to her phone. She checks it only a few times a day.

Have any of you guys experienced this? We are going to try to go on a date over the weekend but I'm kind of tired not being able to be more affectionate or knowing this is headed that way at least. It feels weird bringing this up with her, since I fear I might come across as insecure or pushy. I'm actually really surprised we have lasted as long as we have based on their being absolutely no sex involved. I usually will assume they aren't interested or lose interest myself. So I guess we really like each other? Thoughts?",AskMen,1507817017,programredial,35,6,True,2017-10-12

I have $2500 that I want to spend on finding a girlfriend. How would you spend it?,"So I am a guy who just recently had my first date / girlfriend at 34.  She broke it up with me saying she didn't have those feelings anymore.  Well it was a blow to my system, and somewhat still feels bad.  I would like to find someone to spend time with, and overall love me as much as I love them.  The problem is that I fear the only time I will ever hug, cuddle, or have sex with another women is with an escort.  I have the money for it but I feel like the only thing that will be going through my head would be they are only there because I am paying them.  So instead I am setting aside $2500 (obviously more if I am in a relationship) to find someone.  I feel like human chum with so many women holding out for attractive guys only.  I am an average looking guy.

So how would you guys do it?  Should I give up all together?  Move to another state or even country where women are OK with dating someone who looks like me (see below for my stats)?

Here are some of my stats

* Best physical condition of my life (hiking, taking dog out on walks, climbing)

* I have all of my hair (I keep it clean)

* Custom dress shirts and nice jeans are my goto outfit because I am comfortable in both

* 6 ft.

* Driven to a goal professionally

* I am not a millionaire but I have a steady job (paying the bills) and two startups that I get some extra money for but looking to expand

Disclaimers

* I am half black / half white (tan) and I currently live in Minnesota

* So far all women that I have asked on dates in Minnesota have so far said ""I am not their type."" or the fun, ""Let's just be friends.""  Most have ghosted me all together.  Once I was told that she, ""Didn't date black people.""  Overall, I think women here stick to their own race.

* I have tried the ""don't look for anyone,"" and, ""stop looking and they will fall into your lap"", it hasn't worked for the past decade :)

* I have lived in Minnesota most of my life

What I have tried

* OkCupid, eHarmony (not currently on either because almost no responses)

* Take my dog out on walks

* Some social meetups",AskMen,1506512720,doggydayafternoon,39,6,True,2017-09-27

"Men, what did you do to get yourself out of a seemingly bottomless hole?","Hey all, 

This isn't the happiest subject to think about, but I really need some solid advice and stories from those who have dug themselves out of a massive pile of garbage they called a life, just to know things get better. 

Let's just say things are really bad for me right now. I'm chronically ill with a disease that will never go away and makes it hard for me to work and function like a normal person. I'm also majorly depressed to the point where none of the anti-depressants I've gone on have done anything other than make me suicidal (which is why I stopped taking them). I've never gotten a full-time job in my field (education) probably due to a mix of over-saturation, sickness, and depression...which has led to a mixture of student and personal debt. I feel like I'm falling so far behind my friends, who are all so much more successful, happy, and healthy than I am. 

Naturally, I feel like a total failure, and like nothing will ever go right and I will keep sinking further into this line of thinking until there's no way out. I need a change, maybe some good career advice or an opportunity to just be positive once. I just sit in the same room all day every day, alone.

How can I know if my roommate has feelings for me?,"I had a crush on him before he moved in.

I'm trying not to read too much into it. We're both single, attractive people. We get along very well. I know better than to sleep with my roommate. I know it's a recipe for disaster. But real emotions are manifesting and it's becoming a struggle to stay quiet about how I feel. I shouldn't get this specific because I don't know if he's on Reddit, but he told me recently that he's very comfortable in the apartment and that it feels like he's lived there longer than he has.

What is the worst backhanded compliment you accidentally gave someone?,"Basically have you ever had good intentions when trying to compliment someone, but once the words actually left your mouth you realized you're a dip-shit?

I was talking to one of my (f)riends who I genuinely think is really pretty. I don't like her or anything, but she was talking to me about her ex boyfriend wanting to get drinks to catch up with her. This guy kind of shit on her so she wanted to get super dressed up to show him what he missed out on. When she said this I said ""That's perfect because you seriously are in the top 3% of all babes when you try""... Nice

I wanted to convey that her plan would probably work because, although she always looks good, she *really* looks good when she gets dressed up. Maybe that's just a shitty thing to say in general, but anyway I backpedaled like hell but I could still tell she was upset by what I said.

I really just want to feel better about myself. What is your worst accidental backhanded compliment?

F* Old Spice. What alternative do you use?,"TL;DR What deodorant would you recommend?

My friend had been using Old Spice Fresh for the last 20years.  People loved it on him; guys would ask about his cologne, girls would sidle up and say he smelled really good.  

He didn't know Old Spice changed their formula until this year because he had a large stock from Amazon (which apparently was going through older stock until just recently).

But now, it smells terrible, like chemical soap.

So he tried some other brands and scents.
He has smelled like weak orange soda, bathroom cleaning supplies, cleaning soap, locker room, gas station toilet cleaner, floral tea, and fake flowers.  None of it is good and he says whenever he catches a whiff of himself he gags a little.

"AskMen, what signs you give when you don't want to be someone's friend?","*what signs do you give

I want to be friends with this one, seemingly cool co worker. He's really funny and calm, but I just don't think he likes me. I try to talk to him but he seems a bit aggressive (or maybe that's just him idk). Maybe I'm just being annoying and bothering him?  Maybe I should just stop trying, but I just want to know what are some signs that you don't want to be someone's friend. I know that not everyone will like me but I still need to know.

Edit: I'm a woman. This guy is kinda shy and awkward with people with new people. You might think, ""maybe he's shy because he hasn't met you yet."" No, he's already good friends with the new co worker and she *just* started work (whereas I've been here longer). 

Edit #2: Maybe I should've mentioned this, occasionally, he does joke around with me *at work*. He makes small, harmless jokes but then we get back to work. Not only with me, but with most other people too. Although, *outside of work*, when I try to talk to him, that's when he seems aggressive^. 

But okay, I see the point: at this point, if he comes up to talk to me, he wants to get to know me. If not, then he doesn't want to. 


Update: I tried talking to him today at work, he didn't keep the convo going. I'll just stop talking to him completely and see if he comes to me, but he probably won't

How do you cope with girl-related fuck ups?,"So a much needed, and cathartic backstory first:

I recently moved to another country and was approached at a test centre by this hot chick, around my age, with a pretty face, who turned out was from the same country as me (she noticed bc of my accent and approached me). She started a conversation in two occasions (before and after the test), and she had an overall pretty cool attitude too

A girl like that had never approached me like that before, so naturally I went nervous and messed up like a dumbfuck. I made a very shitty small talk, and not only did I not get her number but I didnt even get to exchange names (I probably scared her off midway through the ""conversation"" now that I think about it)

 This was at an admission test centre that applies for any university in the country, at a very populated city, so my only options are either forgetting about her or becoming an interpol detective to stalk her. It saddens me not only because she was very good looking but also because she really seemed like my type (and she fucking approached me what the fuck still cant believe it)

I already told my group of friends and they made sure to let me know what a dumbass I am, but I'd like some emotional assistance.**So how do you, wise and experienced men of reddit, usually cope with a cringey and regretful situation like this?**

Due to foreclosure, they are moving apart as they should have long ago. My mother and father had good intentions for me. My mother is fine. My father and I have a difficult relationship. I read NMMNG last month and the parts about fathers stuck to me.    
  

Long story short, after tomorrow when I leave for college I don't think I will be seeing my dad for a while. I also don't know if I should keep it that way because he's my father and he wants the best for me. I'm young, inexperienced, naive, and don't know what I will regret doing, but I've been trying hard to connect with my father for years now or even try to offer him some help in any way I can. It's extremely difficult watching him crash financially and go deeper into depression that I'm more worried about if he is isolated from the world and potentially homeless living with family for a while. I don't want to carry helping him as a burden because I've tried with others and their financial situation even though I only had $20 to my name, and it was a mistake. I don't know what to do because I feel like keeping him around will only make things worse for me, and especially my mother due to him leeching off of anyone around him.   
   
Can you provide your insight to me please? I'm only 20, an only child, and I don't know what to do in this situation.

Why do I keep losing guy-friends?,"We're friends. Platonic. You express interest in me, I politely decline, you say it's cool and we continue being friends.


I give some time of not being too close so that you can get over whatever your interest was. Everything is normal after a while.


Then some time after you find a girl you start dating.


I notice we're barely in touch anymore. When I try to get in touch, you seem AWOL. I stop for a while, and notice months are passing and zero contact from you. I wonder if we're even friends at all anymore.


I look up your social media and realize you got into a relationship during this time.


We run into each other at a party or a store, and instead of being a nice catch-up/hello of old friends - instead it's awkward and you act like we barely no each other.


Why?


Is it that you only stay friends until you find another girl you like, meanwhile clinging to hope I might change my mind?

Is it that your new girlfriend doesn't want you to be in contact with girls you had feelings for?

Something else?


I don't feel this is a natural progression of just a guy-friend getting into a relationships since they have no issue maintaining other guy or girl friends it seems. I am tired of this happening. To be clear, I don't string guys along. I reject them firmly but nicely. I don't flirt and keep them around for my own sake or shit like that. I don't ignore them afterwards completely, but I distance myself a bit at first so that it isn't weird. I ask them if they're still cool being friends and they say yes. So then why do they drop me as a friend once they find a girl to date..


Edit: A lot of these starting as friendships with guys though mutual friends who were actually pursuing my female friends at the time. So I believe they friendship would've started off as genuinely platonic. I know from some cases previously where their new girlfriends actually told them to stop talking to me (despite my complete lack of interest romantically), but I would've hoped that would stop happening as people get older...  I'm finding it useful if I can understand the range of reasons though and what seems to be most common though.

How do you find time for your hobbies when working full time?,"I just got a full time job. It's going well, but I'm having a hard time finding time for my hobbies and doing things that I like doing.

While in school and job-hunting, I got up around 9, went for a hike/run/played disk golf/regular golf, ate lunch, then had the rest of the afternoon to work on projects that I've created for myself as well as household tasks like cleaning, managing finances, organizing things, etc., etc.

Now, I get up at 6:30 and I'm busy until 5:30pm.  But by this time, I'm pretty tired. Definitely not up to going for a run. And to make things worse, I only have six hours until I need to go to bed.

I feel like my free time is a third of what it used to be. **I totally get that this is how it works**, but I'm trying to figure out how I can still pursue my interests and keep my life in order. (Exercise and my hobbies really bring happiness to my life.) Also, I had problems finishing projects even before I had the job. I have so much I wanted to do.

The only solution is to do something physical right after work. Problem is that it's going to start getting dark sooner, so I won't even have 2 hours of daylight soon.

I don't have any ideas about the hobbies other than to do what I can on weekday nights, even though I'm tired.

Looking for any ideas or advice on how to better cope with this.

How do you recover from a sex slump in a relationship? How do you understand what your body is telling you during intercourse?,"**tldr at bottom** I've been dating my girlfriend now for 2 years, we're both 18 now. Everything has ran smoothly until the last month or so. I don't know what it is, but I can't seem to stay 'up' during sex anymore? I don't think it is necessarily a penis problem, but it's like I am craving sex and once its initiated I kinda lose my libido just before we actually have sex. I honestly can't understand what my body tries to tell me, it's like I think I am horny then all of a sudden I lose everything straight away? I thought it may have been the porn, but i'm not sure. We usually only see each other once or twice a week so sex is usually once a week. Our sex life has been okay in the past but i'm starting to recognise the problem - that our sex has gone stale due to a lack of experimentation. My girlfriend hates head first of all, it isn't enough for her and she doesn't enjoy it. There's a limited number of things I can actually do to turn her on physically, and I've tried them all - but she prompts me to 'turn her on more.' I am that seductive guy during foreplay and I do it quite well, but because sometimes it's the same thing over and over she's becoming to used to the norm. I don't really get the kick I used to get from looking at my girlfriend either, mainly because we're always naked so it mentally that doesn't help during intercourse. I feel like i'm convincing myself half of the time that I want sex when I'm not sure if I really do? I've always had a really high libido.. but for some reason as SOON as we start penetration its meh. I first of all hate condoms, its like I am dry humping her cause I can barely feel any sensation from it. (I use the SKYN brand) We tease here and there going in bare and it feels 10000000x better and then I put it on and we both kinda slow down and yeah.. it dies and nothing happens. Whenever we have sex most of the time I am trying to talk myself into having an orgasm. I thought it would only be a temporary thing but it has happened ~10 times now in a row and I just can't seem to understand my body. We really only have sex in missionary.. just because doggy and other cliche positions don't seem to work too well for us. She doesn't moan because that's just her and that's a big turn on for me, so its really me focusing on actually trying to orgasm - because the bloody condom restricts so much sensation. I'm in a real sex slump and I have no idea how to pull both of us out. I just want to have some sex where I don't flop and I actually orgasm. It's generally not hard for me, I can masturbate in 5 mins but last 40 minutes in bed. If anyone can help me understand my thoughts and judgements and help me come up with a possible solution, or to let me know if my situation is normal, please let me know!! My relationship is really at an all time low and I'm scared i'll lose her. 

TL;DR - Sex is in a slump, not sure if I get as turned on anymore from my GF during sex due to stale and repetitive intercourse, cant stay hard because the condom allows for hardly any sensation (SKYN brand), talk myself into having an orgasm because I want to make her feel good and turn my relationship upside down finally. Not sure how to recover from this.

So I have a bit of a moral dilemma. My friend has been dating this girl for about 18 months and since this time we have got along like a house on fire. It's now come to my attention that the relationship is dead after a long time of ridiculous arguments and party squabbles. I would really like to ask her out but I know it's going to be horribly awkward. Within the group it has happened before so precedent has been set in my eyes but what kind of time frame should I leave it for before sitting down with him and telling him about how I feel?

Just to be clear, I don't just want to hook up with this girl. I have genuine feelings for her and my happiness is important to me.

I used to love video games and still think I do. I read about them, think they sound interesting but I always get bored and stop caring about each one after a few days of playing.

I used to love reading. I still go to bookstores, excited to get something but then I either decide that I don't want anything or I barely read anything. There are tons of TV shows that sound like I would enjoy but I don't feel like bothering with them.

I started a garden this year and while I no longer fully enjoy it, I keep working in it because it needs to be done now that it's going well.

I don't feel depressed, down, sad, etc. I just seem to have no interest or excitement anymore. I'm not walking around unhappy and am ok with my life, I just feel like I have no hobbies anymore. I've tried to think of other things that interest me but after a little bit of time with them, I'm over it and don't care anymore.

"I may be getting a promotion but I'm not sure if I'm ready for the responsibility, what would you do?","I'm the least tenured employee in my department but past experience and a good brain for my kind of work seem to have gotten me noticed. Department analytics show that I've been matching senior employees in productivity and I've also implemented some changes to company processes that will save the company money down the line, something my peers don't even bother getting themselves involved with. By all accounts, management wants to move me up. 

I've had work experience doing the job they want to promote me to and I've seen the amount of continuing education and studying I'd have to do on my own time to excel at this job. I'm capable of doing the work but I'll probably hate myself for the several months it'll take me before I'm comfortable handling all the responsibilities. 

I'll be salary and making about 25% more than my hourly rate I have now. So I'm mixed about that because I get a lot of volunteer overtime which will now be expected of me. I will have the opportunity to work from home some days so that will be nice.

What to do when you tend to stick your dick in crazy?,"Hello /r/AskMen!

I'm a fairly responsible guy with a secure job and rather clear life goals. Despite that, or maybe because of that, I tend to be **very** attracted to women who don't exactly have their shit together. It can range from just being a little bit of a drifter to full-on taking drugs, partying, absolute lack of direction in life and possibly undiagnosed mental illness.

At the begining relationships with women like that tend to work okay - having a stable anchor in their life means that they can go wild but still have someone who looks after them. But at the end our long-term life goals always clash and the relationship ends with frustration and the feeling of disappointment on both sides.

I want to change that pattern. I want to learn how to appreciate women who have ambition beyond getting baked every day and who grew out of being a constant rebel without a cause. I want to learn how to stop subconsciously seeing them as ""boring"".",AskMen,1500028572,twdziki,42,19,True,2017-07-14
I'm 22 and might be dating a 16 year old. What are some things to consider in this age difference?," EDIT: Just to confirm, the age of consent is 16 in the UK, and she has finished school.  
  
Some context:
We met on a holiday. I was on holiday with my sisters, staying at a nice Hotel. I was making lots of friends as you generally do. Got into conversation with this girl and she told me she was 17 years old. We hit it off quite well, and had fun together just chilling out. I was never seeking out anyone younger than me and never have.. I talked to her parents a bit while there and they seemed amiable enough  and she had obviously told them about me as they knew my name already and such. a few days later she told me shes actually TURNING 17 in 6 months.  its possible that i misheard the turning point initially.

Anyway since the holiday has ended we have been texting a bit. We actually live quite close to each other and dating is on the cards as she keeps hitting at the idea but I really need to know what things i should be considering here. im not really comfortable with it. 17 would be borderline for me, but 16 is nope territory at a surface level.
In terms of where  we are at in  life, she has finished school and is starting college(UK college, not university) and i'm working but also going back to college for a year in Sept and then university a year later. I have been working since i finished school. we aren't on extremely different paths/phases at this time.

"FAQ FRIDAY: Does age matter when dating? If you've had to deal with significant age gaps in a relationship, what advice do you have for others?","Hello and happy Friday! Over the course of the next few weeks I will be making an effort to update some of the older archived links on our FAQ page. This way y'all can stop whining about posts being old when we tell you to reference the page before making a post.

So for this week it's all about age and dating. Here are a few questions to help guide the discussion:


* Does a person's age affect if you would consider dating them? If yes, what is your range?
* Do you view someone differently if they are dating/have dated someone out of their age range?
* Have you ever been a relationship with a large age gap (5+ years)? Are they a bad idea?

How to get back in touch with a girl I crushed on in college?,"So I'm not a guy that easily develops real feelings for women beyond just enjoying their physical attractiveness. I'm 22 and there have only been a few girls in my life that I've felt like I had enough chemistry with that I could make a long-term relationship last with. One of them was a girl I met sophomore year of college, and I'm pretty sure there was some sort of mutual physical attraction there, because she drunkenly front-grinded on me at a nightclub soon after we met, and she always seemed to be really excited to see me whenever I'd see her out at a bar or club. She came over to my apartment to study and hang out once that year, but otherwise we haven't really hung out as platonic friends at all, even though we've had some quality conversations when we'd see each other in classes, out around campus, etc. Unfortunately, she was dating a guy for almost the entire time we knew each other, and that lasted up until a few weeks ago (at least as far as I can tell from Facebook, bc she changed her relationship status to single). He was a nice guy but was kind of an underachiever type, so I was honestly surprised that they lasted for as long as they did.
Anyway, I haven't seen her in about a year now, but we still live in the same city, and I'd really like to see if I can get back in touch.

"Hey men of reddit, I'm curious... how would you describe your obligations to your family?","Hey all! I was browsing the subreddit and I noticed a post that asked the men of reddit what they hated the most about the sub. One reply I found really interesting. The redditor essentially said he wished more men who were older would post and share.

&amp;nbsp;

So, here I am. I'm 38 and I care for an elderly parent(mother) and a sister recovering from a stroke. They both fell ill in the same year and my mom last year almost died from a severe pneumonia. Anyway, my experience got me thinking about modern men's roles in the family. So, here's the catch... when I say family I do NOT mean your wife or your children. I mean the family you're from. Often in households young women are given responsibilities and men are too. Well, tell me about your obligations! Tell me why it's important to you. How does it help the family? Can you do more? Do you enjoy it?

Final question: How do you see your relationship with your family as you get older? Women tend to be very good at building social networks. Men, as we get older we become more alone and isolated. Share with the community some strategies you might adopt to prevent isolation and alienation.

What is the strangest sex request anyone ever asked of you?,"I think its time to tell this. Dont care if anyone believes me or not, I'll put this out here. There are fucked up people out there and its best that people be very careful with the strangers they sleep with or they may end up sumwhere ugly.

Two years ago when I was still in college, I received a message from an older lady in a dating site. She looked like a hundred $$$, she was attractive and after a few chats well she didnt seem like she would hack me with an ax postsex. So I went to her place which was a bit far and when I came it was very nice and well sum women want a lil chat first so we did that while she gave me sum small sandwiches and wine. 

When it was sexytime she led me to her nice big bed and even then I felt very weird like I aint myself? When I undressed her I was very surprised cuz she had all these scars. Then I thought fuck that cuz hey I'm already here and I aint realy turned off so we started making out and then she started saying these weird words and I dunno it was like I knew I was tapping her but I was watchin from far away at the same time and I DONT use drugs. Then when I was pumpin she stopped me and reached over and opened this box full of shiny things and thats when she made her request. She wanted blood play.

I knew I did it but it was like I was in a dream so I still dont understand everything. What I truly remember is that the entire time tho I know we were alone I feel that sumone's watchin and it was fuckin creepy. After sum time she said I had nice skin and she was runnin her hands all over me and she said she wanted to share things with me cuz I've been nice and I knew she's gonna cut me and I was beggin her not to. When I said that its like she snapped and she told me I had to go. She called this man and told him to drive me to the bus station quickly so I got there without even taking a shower.

Never told this til now cuz I think I was drugged tho I dunno if I was raped? I would look pathetic if it got out but since this is an anon acount I can share it I think. And I guess I just wanna keep it out of my mind too but sum books I'm readin reminded me of it and now I wont touch them anymore.

Btw I never went back and I dont know her adress now cuz I fuckin closed my acount in that dating site and never opened another one there cuz wth. Moral lesson is dont drink or eat anythin a stranger offers you specialy if your in their teritory.

How have you moved passed emotionally abusive relationships?,"Thanks to my amazing therapist I have come to the realization that my last LTR of four years was very emotionally abusive. From telling me she wouldn't have sex with me because I was unattractive, didn't like the way I dressed, or didn't think I was very smart. We wouldn't have sex for 8, 9, 10, 14 months at a time. I couldn't kiss her open mouthed or touch any part of her body without her recoiling in fear. The whole time I thought I was the problem when really it was her for refusing to get therapy for her problems and just looking for problems with me because she was too scared to turn the lense on herself.

It's not the rejection which has been bothering me, even though that does hurt like hell, it's the reason as to why.

 This past weekend we were out at a bar, with a couple of other friends, and we both got wasted. During this point I basically asked her out. To which she replied ""youd be perfect if you were better looking."" I'm not very much into the romance bullshit, but I could literally feel my heart breaking after that. It's been a couple of days and she doesn't recollect saying anything to me. However, I can't shake this feeling of incompetance. We did everything together since we were 12. I thought she was the one. And to basically get rejected for something I can't control (I can't change my face), has left me lost and in a bunch of anxiety. I'm not asking for a pity party, I just wanna know how can I deal with this so it doesn't ruin my life because right now I feel so defeated.

How do I deal with my dad dying,"21 year old guy here. My dad is 58, diabetic, and obese.

When he does, how to I mourn as a man and take care of my mum and sister. Also, I was going to go on exchange in Europe for college from September to January. My dad would love me to go besides his condition, but I don't want to regret not being with him when he dies (even though this could be in a few years time).

"People often say it's not about the looks, it's the personality that matters. But how important is it for your SO to think you're hot?","EDIT 3: So I just read a comment by /u/Iknowr1te and it really hit the nail on the head when it came to explaining the situation in regards to how people read this vs what actually happened, so I felt it was fitting to open the post with it, given how upset some people have gotten over this. Here it is: 

&gt;Different expectations for different people. You also can't expect people to read things in writing the same way you meant to.
I would be more likely to join in the self depreciation joke fest. If I have that kind of relationship with said person. If your relationship isn't as jokish it can come across as a shitty thing to say.
You also shouldn't be joking about things that actually worry the person. So if your attractiveness is a sense of worry best not to joke about it.

Soooo here is the post:

I had a weird moment last night. 

My SO said something about her food being hot and sweet at the same time, so I cracked the line of ""sounds like me""... But even with her giggle, she said it was funny because I'm not actually that hot. 

This isn't new to me though. Even on our first date, she said I was much cuter than I was hot. It's a weird feeling to be called cute as a guy, but it is what it is. Anyway, this had me thinking. She doesn't find me hot, but is clearly attracted to me enough to stick around for just over a year now simply because I'm cute and she loves my personality. 

So, to the guys who are reading this I have to ask. Would you find it weird if your SO didn't think you were hot?

EDIT: Reading over this again makes me seem kind of vain. That's not it, trust me. It's simple curiosity at this point, I don't tend to care much about being considered hot. 

EDIT 2: So.. This post is coming up on 3k views and 100 comments. I feel I have to write this now, given people still have a misunderstanding. This was not a hate filled reply. She didn't break my heart in saying it, or offend me in any way. Like I said in my first edit (which I wrote minutes after the post..), I don't care much for being called hot or praised for my good looks. It didn't bother me when she said it, so please.. I'm not the victim here. A lot of people seem to be getting offended on my behalf or believing her to be a bitch, and quite frankly I don't care for it. The humor was too well placed and we're always open anyway. It would be different if she brought up in a serious matter that ""_____ I don't find you hot."" But that's not the case. We've been together too long for it to be a deciding factor, and she's still attracted to me. She simply doesn't find me to be hot. 

So, to end my little rant, I would just like to reiterate that I am not hurt in this situation. You may be hurt if your SO said it to you, but mine said it during a humorous, 'banter' filled conversation and it wasn't a jaw dropping moment for both of us.

"Guys that have graduated college, what are some of the finer things in life?","**just to clarify, I didn't mean to degrade non college grads. I just was using that to describe people who have began living as real adults, and not as high school or college kids. While me saying that clearly exposes a bias I have towards how common college graduation is, but i really dont believe that a man obtains worth from his degree. The only important thing is finding a career that fulfills you and allows you to live happily. **

Hey guys,

So as a current college student who is finally in possession of a well-paying internship, I, for once, have some spending money.

Without turning this into a therapy post, I am quite easily bored and have found life quite dull in general. In the past couple years, I have developed an interest in some simple, but fantastic pleasures. I have been vastly happier since the discovery of drugs, alcohol, sex, etc... But while natty's, marlboros, and weed are great, I've recently been using my spending money to focus on some more refined pleasures. 

Specifically speaking, fine food, cocktails, cigars, and craft beer. I have fallen in love with cooking, bartending, and the like. Wow, I've been missing out. What other things of this nature are younger men missing? I've started straight razor shaving this year, for example, and the process is elegant and therapeutically relaxing. Golfing has also been a great addition to my life.

TL/DR: OP is a pretentious dick, and wants to know what other hobbies would be interesting to explore.

How do you get over emotional numbness/apathy? [20M],"This is a topic I've tried talking to my friends about and I think they are just as lost as I am. We all go to a pretty good university, but haven't really found our place there. So I figured I might ask some other men if they've felt something similar/gotten over it etc. 

I guess a little background to start. I'm a pretty outgoing guy, I wasn't really in my element in high school and switched high schools half-way through. This made it so I didn't have really close friends save 2-3 from either school. Regardless, in college, I found a great group of friends and a fledgling passion to pursue a career in business. I got super involved in the appropriate clubs and moved up to leadership positions in those clubs etc. First semester, I was in a good headspace, but I took a class that turned out to be really tough and my GPA started off a little too low for my career ambitions. I was able to bring it up over the next two semesters and get internships along the way for both my freshman and sophomore summers. This past semester, I just stopped being interested in school, I think career-wise I made some good decisions, but my GPA was negatively impacted. Again, it's not a dire situation, so I feel like a little bitch complaining about it, but at my school, everyone interested in this career path has a 3.7+, I'm sitting a little lower than that.

I used to be really passionate about learning stuff and going and doing things. Nowadays, I have trouble getting out of bed, going to sleep, controlling my diet, just general discipline issues. I don't know what to do, I just feel like I've lost control and at the same time have hit a roadblock that seems insurmountable. I used to have an excellent memory, but now I have trouble recalling if I even ate earlier that day, or what I ate. Entire weeks go by and I can't account for what I was up to and I wasn't on Xanax or some other Benzo, but I have no idea why as a 20-year-old my memory is complete shit. Is this a common experience for people in their young adult lives? I just don't feel anything anymore about anything except maybe career related stuff. I really don't like that, but I don't know how I can change. 

I used to be really interested in entrepreneurship, building things, learning new things, and exploring the world. I've been fortunate enough to be a part of family that travels a lot, but I hate traveling nowadays too. Luckily, I don't have any demons haunting me yet like drug or alcohol addiction, but in some ways that all seems like it's not that far off. Sometimes the only thing stopping me from ingesting something is that I know I wouldn't be able to control myself and it would lead me into a dark spiral, so for now everything is ok I guess. However, it just seems like it gets worse as the days pass by.

Any advice is appreciated, if this is the wrong sub for this type of post, a point in the correct direction is appreciated.

It seems to me unfair that she doesn't know because I too often masturbate and write about it.

she is my ""kinda ltr"" girlfriend

we don't talk alot about sexy stuff, but she always stresses out how total absolute honesty is a basis for a relationship and almost pretentiously said me some of her very intimate things

I fear she might found out somehow and then...

but since we are in a relationship it's not like I will do it so what's the matter anyways?

Why do I get attached to girls I hookup several times with?,"So this has happened to me like 3-4 times, I meet a hot girl that I want to bang but I don't ""like like"" her or anything then when I meet her and have sex with her, I tell her that I'm not looking for a relationship or anything, to make things clear that it was just sex. If I never fuck the girl again there's absolutely no problem buuut if I fuck the girl a few more times I start to feel this sort of possession feeling over her that I hate because it gets me thinking about her on an emotional way and it's not good for my emotional stability. I met this very hot french girl that I obviously wanted to have sex with and we did like 5 times and it was awesome. One night I took her out and we drank and stuff and she was flirting with my friends, but she was allowed to obviously we weren't anything but friends but I still got a little angry when I saw her flirting. I know that what I had to do was try to flirt with another girl to keep my head away from my french friend but I just couldn't, I was to focused on her talking to my friends (who had asked me before if they could try to fuck her too and I said they obviously could try, she wasn't my gf or anything) So my taller, hotter, richer friend told her to leave the club and they left and probably fucked, felt a little bad not as bad as you think but still felt a little bad. Yesterday I invited her for a drink and she told me she was with one of my friends but she couldn't tell me which one, which felt a little bad too and even worse since I don't know which of my friends she was gonna fuck now. I know she's a slut, just like me, that doesn't bother me I guess. I mean We're both 18 we can have sex with whoever we want but I hate this situation. This isn't the first time but I hope It's the last, I guess it's because I'm 18 and I'm not 100% emotionally mature yet and that she is the only ""piece of ass"" I have at the moment and that my friends are getting a piece makes me mad obviously.

How can I reach out to my messy/irresponsible room mates in a way that's respectful and mature?,"I moved in with one of them into an apartment with some other guys over a year ago. We got along great and I decided to move into a new house with him and his friend. They're great guys and are very smart and have good jobs, but they just can't seem to understand how to live in a house. 

The kitchen is always messy. ALWAYS. I have to spend my rare days off cleaning up after them. It's extra frustrating because I furnished close to 75% of the shared house space. I mean most of the living room furniture, media, kitchenware, dishes, kitchen table, etc. is all mine. I'm happy to share it all, but they've done things like cut their chicken on my nonstick pans, thus ruining the teflon coating. They've also realized that I have all of this stuff so they NEVER get anything for themselves. They also make close to twice as much as I do (student), but that's beside the point.

One of my room mates sent me a picture of a notice on our door from the electric company saying that there was no account registered for the house. I had asked him to set up electricity when we moved in (I had already set up the internet before we even moved) and figured it wouldn't be too much of a challenge. He apologized and said he forgot. We moved in a month and a half ago.

There are other little things that bother me as well like leaving on lights after going to bed (I'm talking like every light in the house), leaving the door unlocked, TV on, etc.. 

The main problem is that I REALLY don't want to come across as someone that has to nag them at every turn. We're all twenty-something guys that are well-educated and busy with work and school. Me having to ask them when we're all home, ""hey guys, who used the electric grill too close to the power cord so that it melted?"" gets a little old, I'd imagine. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this responsibly? Does it sound like I'm being too picky? Any and all help is appreciated.",AskMen,1494849938,musicman3739,8,7,True,2017-05-15

Let me just say I absolutely trust my girlfriend and I know she would never cheat on me or hurt me. But for some reason that insecurity just popped into my head.

When I say travel I mean a haul a camper across the country to jobs and stay for months on end. I was recently told if i went back on the road (where i was for 7 months of her pregnancy) she wouldn't go with me and would end our relationship. At this point its about my son more then anything. She says she needs me home to care for him which i do when i get home from work and on the weekends. I feel like shes trading being comfortable right now for Financial independence.
I have the option to make decent money at my where shes from but i can make double that being on the road. My goals are to pay my house off and save enough for a small shop and an emergency fund as well as pay off my truck and another car, maybe a jeep because why the hell not. I want to be back home and stable by the time he starts school.
I run all the numbers and I can do it in about 3 years. If i decided to do this i am almost positive it will destroy my relationship with my lady. Im not totally sure me and her will work out, great women, shes like many people my age aint down with the life I chose to live. Anybody have any experience with something like this?
tl;dr: Is being financially independent worth the first couple years of my sons life, if i know in the long run it will be best for the family? Thanks all

Dating single mums - would you?,[removed],AskMen,1493535631,nadehzda_,1,2,True,2017-04-30
"Men of Reddit land, how do you feel about dating single mums?","I'm after your thoughts on this. Would you ever date a single mum with two kids? Would it be for short or long term .... or just a one night stand? If not at all, what would be your reasons for not wanting to.

The reason why I'm asking is that I recently left my husband and I have two children. I like to think that I am decent looking, intelligent and have a sense of humour...and I'm only 30 years old so not too young or too old. But I'm just wondering, that when I am ready to date again, will it be possible to find someone again. Or should I face the fact that I will probably be alone for a number of years in the future.

Edit: holy crap...I was not expecting this to be such a popular post - thank you to all that have responded so far. It will take me some time to go through it all. 

To the young men (generally 20s and teens (?)) Thank you for the input. I completely understand where you are coming from. If I was in my 20s again and had no kids, I would agree with you 100%. Just a side note - life doesn't always work out the way you planned. Don't limit your viewpoints too much. Thank you again for the input. 

For the people that have posted well thought out responses, both negative and positive, thank you. It's given me some things to think about. As I said below in posts, I'm not anywhere close to being ready to date at the moment, but this has been eye opening. So thank you to all.

How do I not come across as needy?,"So we were on good terms. Simple hello hi. And that chemistry. I had through a common friend conveyed my interest in her. And she had reciprocated but she was a bit apprehensive because of a bad experience. Anyway training ends and we are to move separate ways and lo and behold this uber shy girl adds me.

And I drop her a text. And do that twice a couple of days apart. But I realize she is not really asking me about myself. So after second chat I break myself away.

For two weeks.

And then when I text her. She. Is. So. Excited. To. See. Me.

And I really want her to like me. And I know she loves to read non-fiction. So I drop names of what I have read. To find a common groud.

'Haha great :)'

I could nor get out of my bed that day.

But I swallow my pride and text her again in a couple of days. We talk about stuff. Families. And this and that.

It has been a week since that. And no communication.

Should I talk to her? After her adding initiative I have initiated the conversation four times. I don't want to come across as needy. I will love to talk to her though but I know I can restrain myself and this time wait it out until she texts or its over.

In general, if I can do something for somebody else, I want to. It's not a problem.

For most of my life, I've downplayed this side of myself and actually gotten a bit of a reputation for being a ""dick"". Mostly via sarcasm, aggressive humor, not genuine acts of malice-- I did this because this is how most people wanted me to act, it seemed like? Or maybe just to keep a bit of a mask on.

As I get older, I want to be myself more. Being myself, I worry that I'm gonna push people away by being a little too friendly, helpful, etc. Or perhaps I will end up being taken advantage of.

I'm a teacher-- so professionally, this personality works for me. But what about in my social life?

How can I be a nice guy without being a ""nice guy""?

I feel like an insecure beta when that's not really who I am, or at least not who I want to be.

I feel like most of people at my school think I'm some socially awkward creep, that they're afraid to talk to, and I'm afraid to break that stigma. Sometimes I think to myself ""why I'm I afraid to speak up, or why don't people talk to me. I'm I that big of a loser. Surely not every could dislike me, I had plenty of friends at my last school"".

Men who are 30+ how did you stay fit/lose weight?,"As a young man (15-17) I managed to lose around 80lbs through LOTS of hard work, and kept it off until around 28. 

I felt great and looked great  (healthy BMI, BF%, etc). 

I stayed in great shape by constantly working out and running, if I stopped, I would put weight on almost immediately. I was constantly absolutely terrified of becoming the fat kid with zero confidence that I was in middle/early high school.

At 29, I had a pretty devastating shoulder injury and was literally not allowed to lift a bic pen for months. After that, Epididymitis. No working out for a month, plus steroids. After that, a pretty major knee injury (family history of double knee replacements = this is just a fact of life apparently)

Obviously, I tried to cut back calorie intake, but I still put on some weight. After I was deemed ok, I lifted heavier weights and more intensely than I had before (no running now due to a knee injury, isn't getting older FUN?). I put on muscle like crazy...but also put on weight. I was listening to a friend of mind who is a bodybuilder about how to ""get strong"" (mainly because I felt extremely insecure in myself after realizing how easily I could be seriously injured), and was inhaling calories to bulk up. 

That said, I'm physically stronger than I've ever been, yet I have quite a belly, and can NOT seem to lose it now that I am 30.

I know that fitness is something ike 60% diet and 40% exercise, but it seems like this belly is just hanging on with a death grip. 

Any suggestions on what worked for you to stay trim? I don't want to look like a bodybuilder, just nice and ""toned"" for pretty wife (and myself if I'm being honest). I can lift quite a bit, run 3+ miles and climb damn near anything, I just can't get this stupid stomach fat to go away. 

ANY and all thoughts/comments/advice are appreciated!!

EDIT:Thank you SO much for all of the amazing advice, links to articles and tips!

"Men who have knowingly slept with someone in a relationship, how did it go?","You led someone to bed fully knowing that she/he already had an SO, is married, etc. Who initiated it? How often did you churn that faithless butter? How did the affair end? And most importantly, did you learn anything from that fuckin experience, pun intended?

Just asked cuz this certain girl sumhow tracked me on FB and sent me a friend request. She was the girlfriend of a good friend. Said bro was a 100% great guy, realy one of the nicest guys I ever met. In my defense I can say it wasnt me that started it, wasnt the one who got us plastered with booze, etc but if it happened again and again that falls flat in its face. Only stopped when I had to go back to college when summer ended.

What did I learn from the entire thing tho? I sorta knew that I am a douche, and tbh I find I dont realy care much except that I was still careful that we wont be found out. I still have a consience tho and I sumtimes feel guilty but thats worth bout squat. I have done it a few more times with disloyal women since, one of whom was my married professor, so I guess on those points I didnt realy learn much.

But what I truly learned was that there is no way of knowin 100% who would stray and who wont. They can be fully devoted, affectionate, passionate even to their partners, but in the end they would still cheat. Dont get me wrong there are still loyal women out there. Its just difficult to tell which camp sumone belongs to. 

Or perhaps I just hang out with the wrong people. I guess that's an easier thing to swallow compared to the sad arbitrariness of it all. 

Btw I accepted her friend request. I learned she has a new preppy yuppy boyfriend (she does know how to pick em) and they live less than 100 miles from here. She's lookin mighty fine now too. I wonder how this would turn out.",AskMen,1490968310,DreamboatSam,49,52,True,2017-03-31

The way i didnt show intimacy and avoided sex(ee had dysfunctions as in erection loss) I behaved bad to it and it created tension. If i'd only known that this is common and it is nothing to dramatically fret over.

The way i treated her and how i acted towards her

The way how toxic i was overall and other things aswell.

All these actions werent intentional.

Men who still keep in touch with ex-lovers: what is your opinion? Where do you draw the line?,"I personally think it's perfectly acceptable to remain friends with ex-boyfriends/lovers/partners/etc. Of the men I've dated, some cut off all ties with an ex, and some still remain close friends with their exs.


However, when does remaining friends with an ex start to cross the line of ""they've got ex baggage"" and are ""potentially going to end up back together""? 


This guy I've been casually seeing has an ex whom he claims is just a close friend, but I've noticed recently that he's been reaching out to her via social media, reconnecting and joking with her, and intermingling with her friends and his friends. I have a feeling they've also been running into each other at the same bar they both frequent. 


I usually wouldn't be alarmed by this, but he doesn't talk about his ex, so I end up speculating. Not that he needs to talk details about her with me, but I also feel that if we're seeing each other, I should at least be aware of his intentions with her and that he really is just that friendly with this ex. He seems secretive about it since he is of the mindset that ""what happens between me and my exs are just that--between only us"". I'm friends with a few exs myself, but I don't go out of my way to communicate with them and befriend their friends. We also don't live in the same cities, so no running into each other in public. I'm always open about my history with guys I date if asked.

What did you learn from your first sexual experiences?,"For me it was that to never again start to catastrophize or make a fuzz about losing an erection and that erections tend to wax and wane throughout the intercourse and fuzzing about it never ever gets it back. And when it goes away it doesnt mean it wont come back. Fuzzing over it, makes the girl also unconfident. Avoiding sex is even worse Staying calm and relaxed shows confidence for you and her.  Sex can be fun without an erection.  It happens, no biggy. And girls are usually very supportive over it and when they care they are there for you. But you have to be assertive to yourself aswell as your partner would be and you have to be calm aswell or in time it will get them aswell. You yourself have to not take it so seriously and make a big deal out of it and just keep doing what you can.( The ED was the most  problematic for me)

Plus how important is communication in terms of sex(outside and inside the bedroom) and fantasy ( from STD to desires and expectations). Not to make huge expectations. Every intercourse doesnt have to and wont be perfect. Communication is especially vital If there dysfunctions or problems involved (ED, PE and etc.). Never to be anxious or afraid to express yourself, even if it feels taboo or uncomfortable. It is IMPORTANT. And the girl will usually stay to support, because she cares.

Oh and there is a lot more of ""sex"" than just PIV. Even the kissing before hand is basically sex as in foreplay. Plus porn is just plain bad for me, because how deluted it can make a young person over sex and how it really is. That is why i made a big deal losing it, thinking i would disappoint the girl and she would leave me and etc.(i was a fool yeah) And watching porn in a relationship just aint okay, it zaps the desire for your lady. Atleast for me. 

Plus obsessing about dick size flaccid(flaccid is irrelevant) or erect aint gonna make it bigger it will just take away the confidence of doing the deed. (Though i didnt really was really obsessed about it or anything, but i was kind of self-consicous over my size, especially over my flaccid size, that i avoided showing it. Didnt have an overall bearing on my losing erection, just made me unconfident and anxious)

And a lot of girls appreciate oral haha. And confidence is really important and crucial. Oh doing a bit research on sex and getting knowledge, never hurts

 Those are my things

What are some textbook signs of a manipulative relationship?,"I already know this is going to sound really stupid so bare with me. I (20M) have been in a relationship (20F) for a little over 2 years now. We spend most of the time long distance because we both are in uni. I've never thought of her as being manipulative but it seems to be more and more apparent to me as of recently. I just want to know if I'm being paranoid or if I'm actually seeing all of this right. The situation that really set it off was when we got into a fight because she has a habit of not saying ""I love you"" before she says goodbye when we talk on the phone. The first time I expressed how much this bothers me, she admitted to doing it purposely (she would wait for me to say it first, making me feel almost like I'm forcing her to say it back). Well fast forward a few months and it's still happening so I decided to not say it unless she says it first because I don't know how else to get It through to her that it's really an issue for me. No matter how many times I tell her how hurtful and annoying it is when she ends the conversation by saying goodbye and won't say I love you, it doesn't seem to matter. After this being an issue for awhile and her getting mad because I didn't say it(b/c she did it again), we got into another fight. She said the reason that she doesn't say it is because it makes her feel uncomfortable(idk it's weird). I'm just suspicious why this is suddenly the reason and wasn't mention earlier on during the multiple other times I brought it up. She then proceeded to tell me that she just likes to hear it and how it's not fair for me to be making a big deal out of something like this when she didn't make a big deal out of not doing PDA because it makes me uncomfortable. Once this happened it start to make me think back on things that have happened in the past. She would tell me stories of how she would trick her parents into getting her things she wanted and such. She also likes to take what I say when we get into fights/arguments and change it so she can use it against me (it's extremely frustrating and we get now where). There are more examples that come to mind as manipulative behavior but this is getting long so I'll spare those who have made it this far. Also sorry my grammar is probably awful.

Back then, I went to this camp when I was around 10 years old. The guy at the time was in college, so basically he's around 12 years older than me. He was my counselor at the camp so that's how I know him. Forward to now when I'm 18, he somehow found my Facebook and added me. The fact that he's basically seen me grow up is just super weird. He's 30 now. He's changed ALOT, but still handsome as ever. He is now married, but he messaged me on Facebook and we chatted it up for a bit. We decide to exchange numbers and then a couple weeks later, I ended up hanging out at his house. His wife is somewhere traveling for a job in another country, so I never brought up that he was married. He still hasn't talked to me about him being married. We didn't do anything sexual either. We don't flirt majorly, but we tend to compliment each other a lot. I'm not sure what to do because I like to keep in touch, I just don't want to be the reason why a marriage is torn apart.

"Wonder if exotic is the right word but men that aren't racially white or black, what kinds of women do you attract?","Particularly those of you in the USA.

Not sure if it is an appropriate question to ask but the truth is, when it comes to dating, women care about race and men of certain races are seen in certain ways. It seems like having exotic looks falls between being either an advantage or disadvantage but I wonder if it depends on the kinds of women you go for, hence why I posted this thread.

It seems like white guys and black guys are the main races in the USA and the main race of men who are considered ""American"". Everyone else seems to be seen as ""foreign"" or ""exotic"" and people have polarizing feelings towards those races. So for the brown and Asian men here, what kinds of women do you attract?

"Askmen, how did you get out of your shell more easily?","So, here's the thing, I (19 y/o college freshman) don't think I'm a bad guy. I'm just, like many people, shy and awkward. I have social anxiety, so meeting people is a struggle. I've dealt with it to the point where I *will* put myself in situations where I have to meet people, but meeting them goes *awfully*. I'm usually shy, reserved, and when I do talk, awkward. My heart races when I talk to someone new.

Now of course, there's the people you see everyday. The people you become comfortable with, and for me, the anxiety reduces after around 2 months. I'll start talking a little bit more. 

Month or so later, I'll get comfortable enough with people that I can do stuff with them *alone*. Just the two of us. 

And then after that we're good. I'm comfortable around them, I'll talk when I feel I have something to say. I'll finally *be myself*. 

And apparently people like me. Because 4 times last year, as we were graduating high school, I had 4 female friends (girls i had known for *years*) confess that they had been interested in me. And I was good friends with plenty of girls. (Which was good because I was pushing myself to interact with more people around that time).

So, girls like me when they get to know me. I don't have a repelling personality.

That's great! The problem is that takes *months*. I'm too reserved, and by the time girls know me and like me, it's either *just as friends*, they're in a relationship with someone else, or I don't like them back *in that way*. It's never actually manifested itself as anything more. 

Now, I know I can get people to like me. How do I do that faster? I see my friends go out, meet a girl, and in a week they're dating. Why can't I do that? How do I get ""out of my shell"" faster? How did you?",AskMen,1487044954,PieInTheSky2020,74,61,True,2017-02-13

Then when I asked her out, she said I was cute and fun to flirt with but she's getting serious with someone else. So I'm basically really confused. Even moreso after seeing her on okcupid today (where I obviously messaged her again casually with a joke). Basically, this sucked because the door was open a crack with how she worded her response to me but I'm also probably not seeing her again for a while so I'm kinda bummed.

I also went on a few dates with women from online this week and one of them really blew me away but I haven't had a response from her yet after that to a casual text so I'm just going to wait and ask her out in a few days again. I'm just lonely and tired of constantly chasing.

"How do you overcome thinking about the ""shallow"" features about your partner that might turn you off? Physical features, age, weight, etc..","This is something I've struggled with in relationships my entire life. I'll think I really like a girl at first...but then I start noticing all of these little things about them that seem like ""dealbreakers""

For example, I'm a butt guy. Its one of the physical features that I'm most attracted to. So I meet a girl who seems awesome, but she has a totally flat butt. I'll first think ""wow, this girl is great"". Then after a while as we get closer, I start thinking ""if this turns into a relationship am I going to be wishing she had a better butt the whole time? Am I settling for this girl when there are other girls out there with great butts? What if we get married, am I OK being with a flat butted girl forever?""

Or I met a girl who is my same age (I'm 27). I've always been more attracted to girls a few years younger. I have this idea that older women are all looking to get married/settle down with kids sooner than I am. So I'll think ""What if I spend the next 2 years of my life with this girl and she wants to get married before I do. If we break things off I'll be nearly 30. Should I even risk it?"" 

Or there will be some benign physical feature I know I should just look past, but keeps coming back into my head.

Its all totally unreasonable and ridiculous. I'm far from perfect myself. I think my main fear is I'm going to be wasting precious time in my life with a girl it will never work with.

I hate being this shallow, but no matter what I do these thoughts creep into my head. I've always been jealous of guys who are able to date women I'd probably see as totally physically incompatible. It seems they have some secret to not being a shitty person I was never given. 

How do you deal with these kinds of shallow thoughts about your partner? Whats the secret to overlooking everything superficial and accepting a person for everything else?

The Mother-Son bond: how has it affected your relationships?,"As women we are often told to observe closely a man's relationship with his mom because this, as the logic goes, will reveal clues about how his relationship with other women in his life (wives, girlfriends) will proceed. I.e. ""How he treats his mom is how he will treat you"" 

I'm interested in a man's perspective on this, especially those of you with less than ideal relationships with your moms. Has this affected the types of partners you've chosen to pursue relationships with? Has it manifested itself in your actual relationships in interesting ways? Is there truth to the advice about men and their moms that women so often receive?

"Guys who had great relationship with their parents/family - when did you move out, and was it tough?","I'm 20 and dropped out of college after a semester and don't plan on going back. I have a consistent income and a bit of cash in the bank (living at home does wonders for your savings). So for all intents and purposes I feel like I'm ready to move out. 

I daydream about my life with my own place all the time - girls over when I want, music up when I want, clothes on when I want, the occasional night time bowl without sneaking outside. Sounds like a dream. 

The problem is, I always read about people being so ready to get out from their parents grip, and to get some space between them and their family, and I don't really have that. My parents and siblings have been incredibly supportive and kind and just an all around amazing part of my life, my whole life - so moving out from an emotional standpoint is pretty tough - not only for me but  for them (I've thrown the idea around quite a bit recently). 

I guess my question is, for those of you with a good relationship with your immediate family, when did you move out, why'd you do it, and how was it? I'm planning on doing it soon, for the independence and personal growth, but I'm eager to hear about how others have dealt with it. ",AskMen,1484447583,moovuhway,2,7,True,2017-01-14

When did you develop a more mature understanding of love and relationships? How did you reach this point?,"I realize that the word ""mature"" is a bit judgy, but that is not the intent. Realistically, everyone's first foray into dating was probably a disaster. Everyone has flaws they need to work on both outside and inside the relationship, and most people have unrealistic expectations of love and how to manage conflict. People freak out and break up when they begin to have negative feelings towards their partner. Some break up good relationships because there is no spark. Others stay in bad relationships because of a spark. 

However, I think at some point, most people seem to evolve from the idea that love should be effortlessly full of happiness and spark to the more complex view that people in any long-term relationship will undergo doubt and rough patches, but love is choice that requires work, patience, and dedication to keep the happiness intact. 

Perhaps your view of love is different from the generic description I provided, but how old were you when you felt your understanding of love and relationships began to change? What brought about that change? ",AskMen,1484495960,acciofirebolt4,11,17,True,2017-01-15

Why have more urinals than toilets when a toilet accomplishes the same task? Can an increased toilet:urinal ratio boost washroom efficiency?,"At work, the men‚Äôs washroom has one urinal and one toilet. I find myself, on a weekly basis, waiting for someone to finish using the one toilet in the whole store. I do not need to urinate thus the urinal is useless to me. But then I started thinking...

Even if I did need to urinate, I prefer to use the toilet because of privacy and I can stand OR sit... whatever I prefer. Moreover, if I did need to poop I can use a toilet too. The way I see it is that since the toilet accomplishes the same task as a urinal, why not just have more toilets than urinals since the toilet gives added bonuses (i.e., sitting when drunk, privacy).

I‚Äôm not saying have no urinals at all, but have 8 toilets and 2 urinals. The urinals are faster, but having 8 toilets lets you do both if needed. Thus, have a larger toilet:urinal washroom ratio.",AskMen,1484498093,marsallro399,17,3,True,2017-01-15

"How to Improve My Life (Make friends, more satisfaction and social life).","So its New Years Eve and here I am sitting at home alone. 

I'm 24, a PE teacher (recently qualified this year), and very dissatisfied with my life and don't know what steps to take to improve it.

I am quite good looking, I work out 4 x a week, play football (train once a week and matches once a week) and work Mon-Fri in a secondary school. 

I have a very limited social life. During the week I go to the gym before work and am up at 5.30 and because of this I am often in bed by 21.00. When I get in from work I often do nothing. I'm sometimes really tired and don't feel like doing anything but I want to overcome this.

I still live with my parents (which I hate). Especially after living away at uni for the past 4 years and having total freedom to being continuously judged and in directly controlled. 

I am single and haven't had sex in ages. I get some interest from girls but the ones that I like never goes anywhere and the ones that like me I often don't like back or see as 'relationship material' so let things slowly drift to nothing. An excuse here and there and the messages slow down. I think that I am very shallow when it comes to looks and girls now. There is a girl that works at my gym who is stunning and she regularly smiles and chats with me but I know that I'd never have to courage to do anything and if I did, my life isn't interesting enough to attract her.

My job can be very long hours. I leave my house at 5.30 and sometimes do not get home til 20.00, due to marking, fixtures or traffic. I have very low job satisfaction and have deteriorated as a teacher from my training. I have very little interest in it and can't see myself doing this for the rest of my life. 

I want to be the best me I can be. I just don't know how to get there.

What the heck is wrong with me? I can't talk in my natural voice!,"I've always been shy and self-conscious. Even unsure at times. So I've gotten used to being soft spoken. Then people may not notice me as much. And hey, if they don't notice, they won't judge. Right?

When I'm with others I feel comfortable with like a close friend or my family, I talk normally with my loud deep voice. But as soon as I go into the world (like at work, where they're used to me be soft spoken) or I meet someone new, it seems like like my confident deep voice forgets it exists and in it's place comes this soft high pitched voice. It's an automatic switch. Before I realize it, people are saying, ""Excuse me?"" ""What did you say?"" ""I'm sorry, can you repeat that.""

What is wrong with me? How do I fix this?? Maybe people will judge, but I want to be heard now.

How to be taken more seriously? Not be the end of every joke and insult?,"I've come to realize that when people make a joke about someone being a loser, weak, stupid, or incompetent, it is always turned towards me in the end and people laugh. For an example today someone said this girl on my floor could easily beat most of the guys at our university in a fight, which was then aimed strictly at me later out of this air, and then followed to say a fucking armadillo could also beat me. Not only this, say there is a joke about people being stupid or idiots people always direct it towards me at the end. When I try to stand up by saying things like, excuse me? or think you're funny? in a clam voice, they say woah don't get angry man. I don't pull this crap on anyone, but somehow its okay for others to do this to me, I've ignored this for a while, but its recently gotten under my skin. I stand up for others but no one does the same in return, and nobody takes my problems seriously but I do for them. I rarely talk about how I feel, but when I do I really need some advice, and don't get any. I understand I shouldn't get anything in return for being there for others, but why the fuck do people always treat me like shit? I hit the gym everyday, and people assume I can't lift a pillow. I treat others with respect, I get shit on in every get together with people. I just don't want to be insulted all the time and be the end of every bad joke.

I've many things, from compression shorts to boxer briefs. 

For compression shorts, hiking up the thigh area to cover the crotch helps, but it smooshes your junk and it feels uncomfortable after a while, especially if the tights are not super thin. 

I tried the same with boxer briefs but because they're super thick, they're only comfortable wearing them normally, but at that point it almost forces skin on skin contact all the same (although it's much better than wearing compression shorts normally).

What do I do if my friend's girlfriend dislikes me???,"A couple of weeks ago, my friend whom I am very close with informed me that his girlfriend does not like the fact that he is friends with me and talks to me frequently. It upsets her whenever she asks him if we are still talking and he says yes. I was not surprised by this as I knew it would only be a matter of time before she says something. He basically told her that he is not going to abandon our friendship and that she has to deal with it.

He and I are very platonic. He knows I like another guy. I never tried to flirt him nor did he. I told him that if she makes him choose between her and me, I would totally understand if he chooses her. After all, she is his girlfriend. He said that he will not leave me and would tell his girlfriend to leave instead if she cannot understand. It makes me happy that he values our friendship but I worry that I may be causing a rift between them even though we're not doing anything wrong. 

I do not want to lose my friend. I love him, not in a romantic manner but he's been an incredibly wonderful person to me. I cannot even fathom breaking up with him. Losing a good friend like him will break my heart..

My SO changed her first name and I'm having trouble adjusting. What can I do?,"So my girlfriend changed her name pretty drastically. She never liked her given first name but she always did like her middle name. So for her birthday this year she asked for everyone to start calling her by her middle name instead.

I'm having a lot of trouble remembering to use her new first name and I was hoping that y'all may offer some help. She's been very understanding with me screwing up so far. She *knows* it's a big adjustment, but I really want to make a good effort for her and do this for her. She hasn't said anything about it yet, but I know it must be registering with her every time I call her by her old name.

All of her friends and even family have made the change already - I'm one of the only people who seems to be having trouble. It's been almost 3 months now.

Any suggestions?

Edit: Since her name is relatively uncommon, I won't say what it is/was here. I will say that it went from 3 letters to 8 and from 2 syllables to 3. No common sounds or letters between the two.

Edit 2: The jig is up! She's seen this thread (not that I really tried to hide it from her with a throwaway or anything). She said that she's touched by my efforts and it really means a lot to her.

A close friend of mine, who doesn't make very good judgment calls when it comes to women, told me to stay away and gave me that generic ""she's kinda nuts"" line...even though I don't think he really knows her that well aside from what his friends have told him. 

I know the obvious answer is, go for it, but just curious as to what you'd do in this situation, since he is one of my closer friends and I trust his judgment on a lot of things, but not really women haha.

How to talk with my fiance about low-testosterone?,"I (semitic 31yo female) adore my husband-to-be (semitic 33yo male and a bundle of neuroses), but he's not the ""manliest"" of men (dont care, love him all the more) and I genuinely believe he may suffer from low-testosterone, should get treatment if so, and I'm not sure how to broach the subject without hurting his feelings terribly. 

The signs of low-T read like a laundry list of issues he's been plagued with his whole life - low body and muscle mass (he's 5'9"", 147lb, without an ounce of muscle), sexual and erectile issues, enlarged breast tissue and nipples, low-libido, potbelly, back pain, and many of the emotional and mental signs.

I know that just because he's not a burly macho man it doesnt mean something is ""wrong"" with him, but I also know that if it IS low-T, it can cause health issues later in life, as well as affecting fertility. He desperately wants children, and I desperately want him to live a long and healthy life, and maybe even feel better about himself physically (as you can imagine from the above, he doesn't have the strongest self-image, even though he's very handsome).

Anyone else ever get romantically involved with a childhood friend? How'd it go?,"MY TLDR;

spent about 2-3 hours everyday at her house since her mom picked us up from school for 2 years. She moved away when I was 9, we've seen each other 3 times since then, once when her family came up (3-4 years ago), once when I was visiting her city (this june), and once when she came up to visit my city (this august)

Smashed a bunch of times that last visit, but we both can't do long distance. I've dated and been with other girls since then, and she's dating a new guy now, and we're just friends, but part of me says 'oh yeah man go after her in the future when the time is right'

Anyways, to those of you who have gotten with a childhood friend, how'd it go? What're your stories?

I know a large part of why I like her is because of that 'childhood friend' thing, is that a good/bad thing? It matters, the big question is should it matter? What's your opinion?

I am not forever alone. Guys do approach me, so I have a dating life. But when I like someone I approach too. 

A few examples: 

1. In a bar: a guy was out with his friends. Actually he said something to me first, but I approached him outside a bar on a cigarette break. We had a small conversation, he seemed interested, but that was it. Next time I met him his friend said something to me, but that was the end. 


2. Tinder guy. I had realistic photos, send him photo even without make up, we taled for weeks. Went on a date, but after date he didn't texted back as wuickly as before and used excuse he doesn't have time when I asked for a 'fuck buddy/casual sex'. 


There are a lot of these stories. A lot of guys doesn't turn me down instatly, but quick enough.

"teachers of AM, what are your thoughts on having a beard?","I'm 29 and a high school math teacher, finally decided this past summer to try and grow a beard.  I've been pleasantly surprised with the outcome.

I teach mainly freshman, and the first week of school, many of my former students (mostly the boys) came to visit and every single one of them commented on how much they like my beard.  It's been a pretty constant topic of conversation, too, I'd say at least twice a week someone talks to me about it.

My question is ... why are boys so fascinated by it?  Lack of being able to grow their own at that age?  Also, this is a private school and boys are not allowed to have facial hair - perhaps that has something to do with it also.",AskMen,1476676665,cauchy7,2,2,True,2016-10-16

Thing is, as I said, I've never had a girlfriend before, but she has had a few boyfriends. Every now and then, if I hear about one of her past exes or see a picture, I'll get super jealous, and it will sometimes lead to me being upset or disappointed, not with her, but with myself. Thoughts about stuff like 'well, I'm not as good looking as them' or 'what if I'm not good enough for her' come around. Just self doubt and shit..

how did you hook up with your work colleague?,"For guys who have 'pulled' girls from their jobs. How did it happen?

I had a job a while ago through an agency and I was the new guy and there were so many hot young girls wondering about, but i'm useless with girls.  

I can't really even picture in my head how it would work, in terms of how the interactions would look, how they'd progress, the 'timeline' between talking to flirting to hooking up etc. How obvious should one be in with their 'interest'/intent.

 Lay it on the line and tell her you think she's hot early on? Just remain playful and wait for her to make it obvious that she likes you and then make a move? Never 'make a move' at work but swap numbers and flirt over text? Invite her out for drinks after you've been 'getting on' for a while? Wait until some sort of 'work drinks with the whole team' type thing and then make a move?

So yeah, if you could give me your story with as much detail as possible, i'd find it interesting!

"Do you typically disclose to a FWB when you start sleeping with other people? Is it awkward if she brings it up, and have you ever lied?","I've been sleeping with a guy for about two months and we went into it with a suggestion from him that we stay casual, but also that we would tell each other if we hooked up with anyone else because we're having unprotected sex.

I am trying to see other guys but I haven't slept with anyone else yet, mostly because he tries to initiate something every day and I tend to prioritize what I know is good sex with him over meeting anyone else.

I'm now assuming he's sleeping with other people because he's been vague when I've asked him about it recently and he usually just tries to change the subject.

I'm concerned from a health standpoint about having unprotected sex with someone who I'm not exclusive with, because even though he said he'd give me a heads up I realize people aren't obligated to anyway. I don't want to keep holding other guys at arm's length and letting this guy take up too much emotional real estate if he's also sleeping with other girls.

I've had an experience in the past where a FWB told me he wasn't sleeping with anyone else only to find out later that he was, so I don't know if it's even worth trying to have  the conversation if we're supposed to be casual.

What has the experience been like for guys who are sleeping with more than one girl? Are there girls you devote more time to? If you aren't sleeping with anyone at the start, do you disclose when you meet someone else and start sleeping with them?

What's the best way for me to bring this up without making the guy feel put on the spot or like he has  to lie about it?",AskMen,1475426478,theburntone,18,1,True,2016-10-02

What is average [fill in the blank] for men? (In relation to sex),"As a female I have **a lot** of questions for you guys...I have asked my SO (and read the FAQ) but he only has his personal experience to speak from, and am left wondering still about things.

.

Like:

1) What is the average male libido? (We only do the deed like 1-2x a week and my libido is higher than that...is that average guys?)

2) Is keeping it up a thing for the average guy, on an average romp? (just curiosity here, not an issue for us [thankfully] )

3) How long do you last *really*? 

2 minutes? 20? More? What? (personal note: I have limited experience and the guys I have been with all lasted about the same length of time...I am curious if what's ""average"" and what's not 

4) Do guys talk about 'pulling one off' (masturbating) and other bedroom related things the way women do? Or is it all bragging like the stereotype?

5) Is (for heterosexuals mostly I guess) it intimidating/off-putting for your GF/SO to have a higher libido? 

Does it make it a ""bother' if she's always wanting/willing?

6) Is decreased libido in a long-term relationship because it's no longer new -- even a little bit?

.

Sorry for all the questions, I'm just SO curious about men and the things 

thx.

How do you charm a charmer?,"I [29F] really like this guy [27M] who works in my building. We're both single and straight. He's not necessarily the best looking but he oozes charm, confidence, and quiet charisma. He's also a very nice, funny guy. He comes from an mind-blowingly wealthy background which probably helps with his self-assuredness, but he has no pretensions. A couple of gay guys in the building have told me they fancy him so I'm sure other women have noticed him too.

I think we've been catching each other's eye, I talk to him quite a bit, he'll come up to me for unnecessary things, and I've felt some light tension but I'm no longer sure of myself. If he's the sort of guy people are naturally attracted to, I could just be sensing that from him. I'm one of few women there, I'm attractive and confident so I receive my fair share of attention anyway.

How do you go about charming someone with so much charm? I imagine he's used to women falling over themselves for him - according to his colleague he ""loves women"" - so how do I not just become another adulator? How do I stand out and flip the charisma game on its head?",AskMen,1474103026,TheOrgiasticFuture,11,12,True,2016-09-17
Men (and women) in open relationships - How do you make it work?,"I posted a comment on how I am in a closed relationship and the sexual intimacy is just not there. He doesn't have the sex drive I have and we have (on multiple occasions) considered doing an open relationship. I'm always the one that shuts the conversation down because, well.... I feel as though I may still be backwards in the thought that relationships should never be open (I don't judge though! Plenty of friends are in open relationships and they make it work!) I've done a lot of thinking this week about my sexual life and how much I hound my fiance for sex when he's just not in the mood. Masturbating does absolutely nothing to curb my ravenous hunger for it, and I don't want him to feel inadequate in that dept - which he has worried about. 

In short: Looking to consider opening my relationship so I can stop being a horn dog to my fiance. Was hoping some people who are successful in their open relationships can give me help on how they make it work :D.",AskMen,1474103098,Bachzag,11,0,True,2016-09-17

What would you do if you had the magic cupboard from The Indian In The Cupboard?,"[The Indian in the Cupboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_in_the_Cupboard), for those that don't know, is a story where a kid gets a magic cupboard that can turn toys into real things. You put a toy in the cupboard, close the door, turn the key, and boom you've got a real whatever you put in there. Darth Vader toy? Living breathing tiny Darth with a real lightsaber and force powers. Toy gun? Real gun.  
**The only restriction is the size of the cupboard.**  
[Example scene of what the cupboard can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYHTnuvA65M)  
  
You could...  
Bring a bunch of barbies to life and command them to have sex with each other  
Bring your favorite heroes and villains to life and make them battle to the death  
Bring a bunch of toy-sized dinosaurs to life to keep or sell them as pets  
Make a real lightsaber to have fun with until you accidentally cut one of your own limbs off  
Turn paper money into real money  
  
REMEMBER: Any toy you bring to life has the same powers that the character is supposed to. If the toy is of a character that can mind-control people then it will be able to control yours or others minds when it comes out of the cupboard. Likewise any toy with a tiny arsenal *will* have those weapons if they're a part of the model.

Instead I only seem to take an interest in women after I've known them for a while and have gotten a sense of their mannerisms and the kinds of things they like to talk about, but this happens so infrequently that the numbers game approach is in no way practical. This basically throws 90% of dating advice out the window, and what's left is only really useful once you're past the first date.

Even then, I think the last time I had anything resembling a crush would have been 10 years ago when I was still in high school. I simply don't know where to meet women in such a way that I could tell whether or not I even want to ask them on a date.

how do I fundamentally change the way I am.,"I'm the kibd of guy who is a real romantic. I tend to grow attached to soneone and fall for them quite quickly and all this has lead to for me is heartache.

I recently started dating a girl and have just been 100% myself. I think she's beautiful and amazing. She has two kids and lives pretty far away so we don't see eachother in person that often.

With this in mind once she commented about the diatance I made it clear that I wouldn't ever ask her to leave her family and everything and that I have no ties here and would happily move closer to her.

Things were going really well, meeting the family etc until she dropped the bombshell that she may not be over her ex.

I'm trying to give her a few days to think of what it is she wants as she keeps saying she can see a great future with me....

The problem is it's tearing me up and Im a mess.
My last girlfriend completely broke my heart in almost the same scenario so now although thisvgirl means the world to me and we arebabgreat couple I'm convinced in my head that it's going to be over üòû

How can I stop being a hopeless romantic underneath everything and learn not grow attached and care for someone?

To what degree does money and career-prospects factor into your decision to stay with someone? What do you think of women who care about those things?,"We all know the extreme of a gold-digger (male or female) who latches onto people for their wealth, and most of us censure this sort of person. We also know the other extreme - the couple that doesn't think of money at all, is bound by love or lust or both - this doesn't seem quite so bad, though perhaps they at times ill prepared for an economic mishap if it happens.

I'm never sure what to think of this. On the one one, we would all like to be loved regardless of our bank account. On the other hand, if a man or a woman has a vision of what their life is, and wants to raise children and have a certain life, that life requires money. Is it wrong to want to marry someone with solid career prospects, or at least potential? And while living a life of indolence where you work just enough to eat and smoke weed isn't wrong, I can see it being a turn off for the sort of person drawn to passion, achievement and other qualities.

Where to meet women as a divorced 31 year old? Never did the dating scene ever and I have some anxiety about it.,"So, I'm going to be getting divorce soon.  My wife and I have drawn everything up, it's an amicable divorce, so I'm not bitter and there was nothing poisonous about the relationship before it dissolved.  Basically we just grew apart, we both realized we really aren't a good fit, and we feel splitting is the best way forward before the relationship start to turn truly toxic.  Our counselor agrees. I have 2 girls with this woman and I will still be in contact with her, we plan to co-parent in the same town.  She doesn't care about me dating women in the slightest so the ex-wife isn't a hindrance.

Anyways, I've been with the same girl since I was 18.  I've never done the dating scene at all.  Actually, I never went out that much to begin with.  I'm a rather insular kind of guy in that way.  I'm to the point where I have been to a bar or club less than 10 times in my life.  I actually get nervous figuring out how to pay for things at a bar even.

Now on the plus side for me, I feel I look good on paper to other women.  I'm 6'4'' and in great shape.  I have a build like Stallone in Rocky I, I'm not ripped, but I'm a big muscular guy.  Stronger than most people.  Looks wise, I'd say I'm a 6-8 out of 10 depending on how I present myself.  I have a steady job where I only work 10 months out of the year, have great hours, and make about 75k (in my state, this isn't bad and isn't great either.)  I'd say I'm a fairly charismatic guy, speaking to people isn't a concern to me at all and I know I'm a pretty funny guy.  I work around people all day, I honestly talk to about 50 people a day so I think that's where my insular nature comes from at the end of the day, I'm just exhausted by people.  Picking up girls at work isn't an option.  Sex isn't a concern for me, I know what I'm doing and I'm a pretty well endowed guy so I have no hang ups or anxieties about the act.  My hobbies are video games/anime/comics, weight lifting, and hiking.  Odd combination of things.



So on paper, I'd say I'm a desirable guy.  I'm loyal though, and over the years of being married to my ex-wife, I never strayed or put much thought into other women. I just put my head down and did what I had to to support my wife and then daughters.  Actually, now that the marriage is over I feel like I can shed a lot of the responsibilities and duties I had as a husband and I'm starting to feel like my old self.  I never knew I missed it actually. I'll always take care of my 2 little girls though and I do have 50/50 custody with them. 



Anyways, where the heck do I meet women at my age haha?  I have no idea what I want in terms of a relationship, I just want someone who is attractive and won't force me to compromise my life. I could get married again if it was something I felt would be enjoyable, but I'm not gunning for that either.  I have my kids, I'm not going to die alone as they say. I've done the stressful life of looking for more money and more responsibility, to working long hours and commuting and being miserable to support a family.  I'm in a good position now where I'm very secure, I have time, and want to enjoy my life.  



I've just been so singularly focused on my family that I have few friends anymore.  Again, I get along great with people, it's just I wouldn't consider many of the people I have around me as true friends to help me in this.  I don't know where to go, how to act, or what to expect out there.






tldr:

Recently divorced guy, 31, so focused on family the past few years I have no social life and I'm not sure how to act out there in the dating world.

Most of the time, it becomes clear that its not gonna work out and we just push it off to the next weekend ""FOR SURE!"" (for which the same thing will happen all over again ofc).

Let's assume for the sake of this example, that the person you're talking to knows your SO's name and saying ""Alex really likes playing tennis."" wouldn't confuse the person because they know you well enough to know your SO's name is Alex.

I've noticed some guys always use their SO's name, but others tend to usually say ""my wife"" or ""the girlfriend"" (i.e. The wife wants to go swimming this weekend.) instead of their SO's name, even when I know their SO, so it's not like I'd be confused if they used the SO's name.

This saturday, I (M24) am have my girlfriend's younger brothers (9 and 11) for the day this weekend and I'm trying to show them a good time. This is the first time that I've had the opportunity to hang out with them, just the three of us. My girlfriend and I have dated for about two years now, and we are pretty serious. I'd like things to go well.
I'm thinking of taking them to the zoo. I'm in Chicago too, so we might go to lunch and watch the airshow.
Can any of you offer similar experiences? Pointers? Pretty nervous about the whole thing.

Suspected grade II sprain and sprained syndesmotic ligaments between my tibia and fibula. I couldn't move for a minute because it hurt too much.

How does a guy who is no longer in college or high school find a way to meet enough people in real life and eventually grow his social media following?

I don't want to add strangers on the internet or some people that I don't even know, I want to actually grow my social media following to the point where I have a lot of friends and followers on some social media sites.

I guess a better way to ask this question would be to ask how to meet a ton of people after college to the point where they want to add you on social media. ",AskMen,1470197210,formerlyadawg,14,0,True,2016-08-02

How did you move on from unrequited love?,"Hey everyone, so there's this girl I've been pinning over for about a year now. We have similar senses of humor and personalities, and I guess that's what I want.

A couple weeks after we met, I asked her out on a date, and while she accepted, she said that dating wasn't for her right now. I found out pretty quickly after that she was letting me down easy, but I've always fostered this feeling that she would come around, but I know that isn't happening anymore. We've staid friends, and while I moved the boundaries a bit, I can't get rid of this feeling every time I see her.

I have two more years of college to spend with her, and while my brain tells me that I don't want to be the second choice of absolutely anyone, I can't let her go. It sucks, and while I know in my head I know I should just ditch her, I just can't seem to do it. I know the best solution is to just drop everything, but I'm having trouble doing this considering we'll interact pretty frequently over the next couple of years due to clubs/classes/etc.

"How should you interpret potential ""signals"" from a girl if you have a history of misinterpreting things?","Hello AskMen. In the past, as many of us have, I've misinterpreted or missed signals from girls. For example, there was this girl that I took a class with, who usually sat right next to me. As time progressed, we ended up getting to be close friends with each other, and she always seemed exceptionally comfortable and happy around me, which I thought was pretty cool. After about a year though, her and I were talking about people we were interested in, and I casually asked her about her dating life, to which I got the response, ""You know I've been into you for like a year now, right?"", which was totally surprising to me. In hindsight, she gave some pretty obvious signals, such as things like pretending to sexily suck on a pencil while *making eye contact*, which I just dismissed as her being weird/quirky. So yeah, stuff like that tends to happen to me, even though it's usually not as extreme.

To cut to the point, if one is aware that they're **really** bad at picking up signals what should they do in the future when they suspect a girl might be giving ""hints"" of that sort? Would it be best to still downplay what you see a girl doing, in terms of signals, just to play it safe, or should you be optimistic about that sort of thing and put more of a mental highlight on the ""little"" things that girls do toward you, since usually things that seem little are actually a big sign of how she feels (well, that's what happens to me at least‚Ä¶)? To give an example of what I mean, there's this girl I've known for a while now, and we're really close friends. She's had a thing for me in the past, and just ended a relationship with another guy a few weeks back for reasons unknown to me. Recently, she's started acting a lot more comfortable with me, physically in particular. For example, she's done this thing a couple of times where when I make a funny joke, she'll sometimes press her head up against my shoulder while giggling and lean up against me, for an unnecessarily long amount of time. She's also been finding reasons to touch me or to get me to touch her a lot recently, and seems very comfortable with it when it happens. 

There are several other things that I've noticed, but I'll spare you guys the reading. So since I have a history of poorly interpreting or completely missing signals from girls, should I downplay those things that I notice her doing, in order to play it safe, or are they signs/signals that I should actually pay attention to despite my history of reading things wrong? Sorry if the answer is obvious, but I unfortunately don't have too much experience with women,  and therefore don't want to potentially screw up things with her.

Thanks guys.",AskMen,1468911107,THE_CRUSTIEST,9,0,True,2016-07-18

"How do I tell a guy I want more from him than monetary generosity? If you've had experiences like this in dating, please share.","I've stated seeing a guy who makes a lot more money than me and so far has been generous about it. But I've dated wealthy before and while I appreciate it, it's not what I want from him. I want more emotional efforts and investments than just paying for my dinner or whatever. The previous guy I dated said he liked paying for things and being generous because it was easier for him than going out of his way to do stuff, and while that was a general comment that extended beyond dating and not specific to me, it really helped me sort out a large issue I had with that relationship. (Needless to say, it ended.)

I'm not sure how to talk about this with the new guy. Have you ever had that kind of conversation? What do you suggest?

What can happen if you don't feel loved in a relationship?,"I'm gonna try and keep this short. (I know this sounds kinda gay, but that's just me.)

I'm always hugging, kissing, asking to hold her hand, cuddling, telling her i appreciate her, feel blessed to have her, and tell her i love her. She however, will just stroke my cheek (after i hug her arm), stroke my hand (after i ask to hold hands), tells me she loves me (after i tell her that or occasionally she does it first but i have to set the mood) and thats about it. 

I mean, i don't mind not getting anything in return, it makes her happy and i honestly do enjoy seeing her happy. Just that recently i've been wanting her to do so too, as a way to feel loved, because she just tells me, but i don't feel it. The only time she made me feel like that, was just up until recently that she told me that she was jealous that a girl slapped my cheek. We talked about our show of affection last Friday, she said she thinks she doesn't show it because we are in public/tries to be in other's shoes/thinks of what others will think, but she also said she is 100% sure she can show more, but she just doesn't. After this conversation, she began to cry and tell me that it is unfair for me to show much more care, compared to her. Then she proposed to show more, but now I'm gonna feel as if it is forced, not genuine. (Think of it as a fake orgasm).

For example (it may sound stupid but there are a lot of small things like these) one time i told her i feel so blessed to have her by my side, she just smiled and laughed, it made her happy and i was glad, but she didnt say anything else, i wished she would have said the same. Another thing is that she won't post about us on social media, i told her this, she proposed to post something, but i didn't let her and told her that if she did it, i'd want for it to be out of her nature/genuine. There is so much more tiny things like these.

I do not know whether or not this is affecting my love for her since recently i've been questioning my feelings for her. So i don't know if you need to feel loved by your SO in order to be IN love with them? Or maybe I'm insecure? Or is it just me me wanting her to make the first move?

 I just dont understand why i'm losing my love for her, and i'm thinking it's this, because in short, i rarely feel loved by her, she says she does and she cares and gets sad when im sad, but really thats where it ends, or is it that im ungrateful? I don't understand.

So basically what do you guys think, do you NEED to feel like that or is just me being stupid.

Men - how do I approach this problem with my (27/f) ex (30/m) and get the desired outcome? Usually he shuts down.,"Hey guys -- I've never posted to reddit and am using a friend's account. Hence any post history isn't mine...

My BF of three years and I decided to ""take a break""/I GUESS break up a few months ago, mainly because we're living in different cities temporarily, and he wants to be single. He's dealt with a lot of financial/job/family/health stressors over the past few years. I get it and went NC, even though I was devastated.

Bottom line though, he wasn't giving me what I needed in the relationship. I was pulling 200% of the weight. He was basically getting everything he wanted and putting forth no effort. I realize this was my fault.

He reached out a few weeks ago and we started talking again. This past week I mentioned I'd be in CA for the weekend (where he lives) ""if he was around."" He responded with, ""All right, I'll let you know if I'm around.""

This pissed me off to no end. It made me feel like I was an option, not a priority. I didn't respond to that text.

Yesterday (Sat) rolls around and he texts me around 4pm. Then he calls. Then he texts a few more times and Snapchats me, all related to if I'm in CA, where am I, etc.

I ignore everything. I am sick of him thinking he can get away with last min plans, not respecting my time, etc.

Problem...I love this guy. I want to rekindle the relationship, but THINGS NEED TO CHANGE.

My question: when I do talk to him, I plan on breezily telling him I broke my phone Friday (actually true) and couldn't get his texts/calls. Then saying, ""I wish you would've made plans in advance, I would've loved to see you.""

The OLD me would yell at him, nag him, probably cry, try to get him to understand my ""feelings"" about this...I have slowly realized this method is not effective.

How are our behaviors sexy/unsexy?,"I was once into the PUA community sadly, it was the only resource I could get my hands on that taught me about dating and it gave me some really toxic beliefs I still cant shred off of my head. I recently scrolled one of my favorite subs and it had an article of a PUA website-now the article was purely supposed to be self help and the continuous addition of 'get pussy' made me cringe when I read it, even though the advice was spot on. I kinda got why many men like me are attracted to these kind of things since nobody tells us how we should/shouldn't behave like with women. I have done things that were downright creepy (I'm a sheltered, and they weren't as creepy but it made me feel misunderstood) until my friends pointed it out. And in my honest opinion, certain mistakes we make on a day to day basis subconsciously MIGHT be big time magic pills (I hate that phrase too, but hear me out)/

Skinny guys how do you deal with people commenting on your size,"Im 18 years, 5'11, I weigh 148 lbs, I'm a size 30. I actually put on weight i used to be 143 and a size 28, Basically i'm built like a dark version of harry style just with a bigger thighs. For some reason my step mom and dad keeps annoying me telling that I am getting skinnier when i myself know i have gained weight.

I use 'my fitness pall' to log what I eat during the day (i'm really trying to eat healthier)  on my iPhone and i'm very active i run/ skateboard almost every day or 2. I really don't know how to respond when they question me about my weight and make claims that are usually uneducated and lack any facts or research. I usually just say i'm within a healthy fitness range and according to the app i am eating right. But then they go on to make more uneducated claims.

My step mom even went as far as saying that i'm to skinny skinny and that i'm losing my abs, and that i'm not eating enough, first of all they aren't around me every single day to tell what i'm eating and second of all to my knowledge i never even had abs and if i'm losing them that would mean i'm getting fatter not skinnier. Also ik for a fact that they aren't within a healthy weight range but i never mention it.

Heard somebody screaming for help in my Apartment complex through the walls - at a loss what to do,"Hey! So i dont really know if this is the right place to ask this but anyway here it goes: 

Location : Germany
So i was out on a wedding, drank beer all night and had the tippycle bathroom situation going on, only i woke up for it at around 6:20 on a saturday. 

As i wanted to continue to sleep afterwards i dindt turn on the lights in my bathroom - which is conected to the vent so it was really dark and especially quiet. 

Thats when i started to periodicly hear / every ~10 seconds a mumbled ""scream"" thorugh the walls. I dindt pay much attention to it as i wanted to finish my business and get back to sleep - but it kept on comming and as i started paying attention i started to make out a somewhat desperate sounding Hello. ( or ""Hallooo"" in german) - at that point i was a little bit intriqued and i went to check if it came from outside so i went to the window to check but heard nothing, but the mumbled sound still was audible in my bathroom. 

At that moment after the regular ""Hallo"" he ( definetly a mans voice) added a "" Holt mich hier raus"" Or "" get me out of here"" 

That was the first time i woke up and really started to think about the situation. The Hello had died down at that time but i swear in the end i heard another, less audible ""Hilfe"" or ""Help"" . 
I dindt want to wake up my roomates but at that point i started to ( and i really felt fucking stupid"" to scream in the bathrom "" IS there somebody"" "" HEllo?"" - but got no answers. 

Called the police reported it 2 officers came at like 6:45 and took a look at the bathroom said they really cant do much and went on their way. 

I am Really creeped out and am at a loss of what to do. 

Might be just somebody screaming in their Sleep,( But that periodicly? ) 

or Somebody watching a movie ( shitty writing then) 

Or it was somebody trapped/ inprisoned really needing help. 

Or i just haluzinated but i have never imagined anything that has ever happend before. 

SO what should i do starting from here? Should i get a recorded for the bathroom and record in the night ? - have 2 female roomates that might be weird. 

What could it have been? I am really at a loss here. 

Well thanks for any answers ! 

TL;DR: Heard creepy pleads for Help coming from within my apartment building in the early morning in my bathroom. Called police - said they cant do anything - How to go on from here?

I'd like to say he did it as a joke, but at school he was the sort of person who you would tell a cool story to, then two weeks later he would repeat the story back to you but with *him* as the hero of the tale.

The saddest one is a friend who is keeping up the pretense of being happily married, when actually he is trying to find the courage to divorce. To make things worse, he met another girl a couple of years back and really fell for her, but because he won't cheat he avoids her rather than telling her how he feels. I can always tell when he is particularly pining for this girl, because that is when he is most likely to upload a smiling ""relfie"" of him and his wife as his profile picture.

I asked why he is putting up such a front on social media and he said it is mostly for the benefit of his parents, because they would be ashamed of him if they knew about the marital issues. Seriously thinking of hiding this guy's feed, as seeing his posts just depress me now I know the truth.

"Men, how do you not get intimidated by people?","I dont mean to whine, and I dont have any social anxiety as well. I remember this incident when I was just 10 and apparently I used to have fun and tease people a lot. A guy once randomly reached to me and started beating me up, he was double my size and he started beating me up. I cried like hell and ran away, and that fear of being intimidated by people continues. I dont tease around because of that fear. I once fell in trouble with yet another dude who just wanted to exert his dominance over me, he once slapped me randomly and I did nothing. I feel really scared of people these days, I dont connect with the big dudes because of being a nerd. I am a big guy btw, but there are bigger dudes that scare me. Also, my parents fight a lot (to this day) and. I was isolated by most of my cousins thanks to family fights.





These issues only I face apparently, many people Ive seen dont seem to be bothered by these things. People smaller than me have much more confidence than me, I guess socializing and being on the good side of people does that. Its a vicious cycle btw, cant get close to people because Im scared of most of them, what if they have a contact that will beat the shit out of me? Why should I even bother standing up for myself if you willbe sent crying home anyway?

How do you guys find pants that actually fit?,"I'm 5'10"", 165. 

When it comes to length, nothing fits. With 30s, I have to pull my pants down way too far. With 32s, I have to pull them way up, and even then the break is a bit too dramatic. I'm literally your average male in terms of height and weight, but can't get a good fit without a hem job. How does anyone else deal when there are literally only 3 pants lengths regularly sold (30"", 32"", 34"")? I mean, if 30"" fits me (ish), how does a guy who's 5'7"" buy pants? How about a guy who's 5'5"", 6'4""? There are literally no pants for those guys, and there are plenty of them around.

When it comes to waist, I get a good fit, but I literally cannot find pants that aren't tight in the leg. I used to be a sprinter, and I still do a lot of squatting, so I've got thicker legs (but nothing outrageous). Straight leg jeans from Banana Republic and similar stores look like skinny jeans on me, and I can't even fit into ""slim"" or ""skinny"" styles.

How can I convince my om that I'm NOT gay?,"This isn't a big deal, I know that, but it's still sort of bothering me. I'm almost 20 and have (sadly) never had a real girlfriend. But I'm very vocal about things, one of which being LGBT rights. At times in the past, just in casual conversation, I would talk about these things with my mom, and she would always ask subtle questions that made me think she was asking indirectly if I was gay. I'd always avoid just flat out saying I'm not gay for a couple of reasons. One, I don't want to look defensive. If I look defensive, I think she'll for sure wonder if I'm gay if she didn't already. And also, for all I know she doesn't think I'm gay at all, and if I just flat out said it then it would seem to come out of left field. And then, of course, she would wonder.

Now, I know my mom wouldn't care if I WAS gay, so don't think I'm afraid of her or anything. But it's still an uncomfortable spot to be in. I have nothing against being gay, but I don't want my mom to have the wrong idea about me either. Part of me thinks this isn't a big deal, and that I should just not worry about it. After all, I'll hopefully be able to show her that I like women at some point. But another part of me wants to just nip any awkward feelings and conversations in the bud and just flat out end any possible wonderings on her side. Any advice on what I should do? And please don't say ""Get a girlfriend."" I know that. And I'm trying, in my own pitiful way lol

"Has anybody here ever had their ""relationship intuition"" proven right? What happened?","So about 7 months ago, my ex met a guy at her college orientation. They were in a big group of other people, but she said that he was really cool and kept talking to him, which I was fine with.

Then, one day we're driving and she tells me that this guy called her ""babe"". She told me that she didn't want to lie to me. My intuition didn't kick in until I asked her to stop talking to him.

She straight up told me that she wouldn't stop being his friend just because of that. That's when I fucking knew something was going to end up happening. In the car I told her that if she didn't drop him out of her life, I would leave her.
She quickly told me that we weren't breaking up, and that I needed to trust her ""Because trust is a big part of relationships"".

We had been through a lot, so I agreed and told her that I would trust her not to do anything. She even called me overbearing.

3 months after that she informs me that she fucked that same guy, ending our 2 year relationship.",AskMen,1462437973,DomrepIII,434,944,True,2016-05-05

What are your thoughts on wanting pats on the back for good deeds?,"We all know someone like that.

I don't specifically go outta my way to do good deeds, but if I saw an elder shambling across the road, I'd either help him along, or stand beside at least till he's safely passed. If I saw a blind person by the bus stop, I'd also guide him to the right bus etc.

I'm asking this because askwomen had a similar thread pointing out the hypocrisy of posting on social media. For me at least, whether or not someone knew about me holding a blind person's hand is secondary. I help the person, and then I'm on my way.

What do you think of social media and friends this day?,"So what on earth is up with all the people my age (20-30) trying to know their whole goddamn city? I live in a failry small city (30-40k people) but it seems like everyone knows each other in my age bracket. If I was giving a birthday party tomorrow, I could barely invite more than 10 people. But that's because I prefer goods friends that I can count on and like instead of 500 acquaintances that I barely know.

But nowadays it seems like a weird competition, especially for girls. Try finding a girl age 20-25 that does not have 500+ facebook friends, using Twitter or Instagram and is stalking EVERYONE and their mother on facebook. What the hell is wrong with people? I remember back in 2009 when I turned 18 the majority of people were more like me, now it seems people went crazy with this crap.

For example theres a girl that I often drive to work with because we have the same commute. When I'm driving, her eyes are **glued** to her smartphone as she's stalking people on FB or instagram and it's nearly impossible to even have a proper conversation, if any at all. If you want a taxi, goddamn take one but I'm not your chauffeur. It was quite funny to see how her whole world crashed when she forgot her phone this monday. She looked so lost, it was ridiculous. Also this strange whatsapp spam that I cannot get behind. I rather prefer to met in person and have real conversations instead of writing on whatsapp with 20+ different people AT ALL TIMES. And then the voice messages that are listened to and recorded EVERYWHERE, no matter the topic or how personal it is. Do you know what privacy is? 

Or yesterday there's been a girl visiting my class that I've never seen before and one of my classmates asks me if I've ever seen her before. I answer no, should I know her? Apparently she's living in the same street as me for 4 years now. Because I have to know EVERYONE in my street, I got nothing better to do. 

So how are you guys doing it? Am I rather in the minority? Am I too backward for this age or just seeing too narrow?

The thing is, I've never really had a FWB situation. I've always been a relationship guy and I'm just utterly sick of them at this point in my life.

What to do when passion conflicts with physical health?,"M/21


For the last few years, I've been dreaming of biking across the US. VA to CA. This year, my last year of university, I finally had the finances and the time to start making it happen.



I got my gear together. I moved the start date of my new job back so that I could have enough time to do what I dreamt of doing. I biked through six inches of Buffalo snow during the winter just so I could get extra training in. When the sun finally came out, I started putting 65 miles a day in the saddle. Grades flatlined, relationships and friendships grew stale, but every day I grew more determined and passionate. I was happy. I was supposed to depart in a month or so, right after graduation.


But there was an intermittent ache in my hip. Some days I felt it, some days I didn't. On a scale of 1-10, the pain was always a 1. I've always been an athlete, so aches rarely bothered me. But, inversely, I knew the difference between an ache and a chronic injury. This wasn't something I should be ignoring, even if the pain was nominal. I saw a Dr. shortly after the pain began. He referred me to a PT who told me it was ""hip tendinitis"" and just gave me some stretches to do.


The pain went away for a bit, but has recently come back.


I saw a different doctor yesterday. I learned that my injury is much more than mere tendinitis and could be exacerbated by my bike trip and cause a lot of problems down the line. On the other hand, the trip might not exacerbate my hip at all. Worst case scenario, I end up with hip arthritis and possibly need a hip replacement down the line.


Oi.


How I see it, I have a few options:

* Do the trip, go until the pain becomes less nominal - probably degrading the health of my hip in the process.

* Don't do the trip, get surgery, 3-4 months recovery, stay inactive the whole summer

This is, very likely, the only opportunity I will have to do this trip - at least until I retire.

 we've been friends since highschool(age 21) but both of them have been single for a long time, and had their last relationships end badly.

we're still friendly, but at some point i started to feel like i was being used as a substitute boyfriend, instead of a friend, so ive decided to just not take part in any of the above events, as it seemed like the only time we hung out was on their terms and for similar events. we had a sizable argument once i brought this up, and they seemed really hurt.

How would you feel if a girl insists on using condoms that she brought?,"Hey so I have a question. I've heard some guys (of course not everyone is the same, I don't want to generalize) will only use condoms that they supply because they think a girl may be poking holes or something in them. 

I've just realized that I have a mild latex allergy though and generally the condoms that guys have are latex. I'm living in Japan currently and most of my hook ups are other foreigners which may or may not be using local condoms. The thing is, I know which Japanese brand condoms are safe for me to use (fucking expensive but it prevents me from being super itchy and bleeding) and I also have some Skyn ones from the US. 

Anyway. Is there a way I should go about this? I don't want them to think I'm doing anything sketchy especially since I'll have to insist that they use mine even if they have their own. ",AskMen,1459851059,Emnems,499,747,True,2016-04-05

What would be a good opener / chat up line for a double dating app?,"I've started using the app ""Double"", which is basically tinder but you sign up with a friend and match up with other pairs for double dates. I think it's a great idea, it could be a lot of fun, hilarious, or maybe even actually a good way to meet a girl. 

But I'm struggling to think of openers or chat up lines to initiate the conversation. 

I like using funny / cheesy chat up lines to open with on tinder as it sets the tone of the conversation to come as flirty and light hearted, so you can chat and get to know each other without it seeming like an interview. 

But it's harder on Double. The girls rarely have a bio, photos other than selfies, or anything else to make an opener with. Also you're chatting to two girls in a four way chat which makes it harder. 

So any ideas? What would be a good / funny opener in this situation? ",AskMen,1459860841,sealturkey,17,1,True,2016-04-05
How to get over serious depression after breakup?,"Hey,

I know this probably has been asked already, but it has been over five months for me and I'm still wrecked mentally over a breakup.  I was with the girl for 8 years (from 17-25) and I was just about to propose when shit hit the fan.  I guess we went in separate directions.  During our relationship I lost some friends and towards the end I was trying to make new friends and reconnect with old, and in the process I probably neglected her.  Now I'm here and I don't have my best friend.  I've done literally everything to get over her - been with multiple other women, been in the gym literally everyday, been eating really healthy, reading, etc.  I still cry everyday and think about her all the time.  Does anybody have any tips for me? I'm desperate.  I am very seriously depressed - like 10/10 depressed - and I want to move forward.

Edit:  thank you all for the input.  It helps a lot to read your advice and see stories from people who went through similar shit and how it gets better.

And a man more cynical than I might say that, yes, it shows how the rich and powerful hide their wealth.  AND, what's the *point* of being rich and powerful if you have to play by the same rules as the rest of the proles?  And besides, the ones named in these papers are the ones *in* power.

"I'm nearly 28 and feeling stunted. I could carry on doing shitty jobs getting to experience life or sacrifice myself for a career feeling more stunted for the years to come... For some it may seem a no-brainer, but life have proven otherwise. What would you men do?","For 2 years now, I've got by having shitty jobs and I've **hated** every minute of it. It gets worse when you see people your age or much younger than you having great jobs which aren't even entry level anymore, getting paid enough money to have all the could possibly want, plus the time to spend it carelessly every weekend...  This is something that crushes me every time. I feel like a failure. I have none of both worlds: nor the career, nor the enjoyment of life even if it's through bad jobs.

Whilst my co-workers have managed to go abroad, and so on, I decided to reduce my hours (and therefore my quality of life) so I could volunteer and study thinking that the sacrifice would equate to getting a better life, but nothing has changed. 

Should I stick to the shitty jobs and forget about a career for now, save as much money as I can and go on holidays, etc...? Or should I keep on delaying all those trips, nights out and so on so as to focus on my career? Either way, if I start a career when I am 30, I will feel even more stunted than I feel now. At the same time, I don't think I can do shitty jobs for much longer...

And yes, they are exclusive options because I'm low income and have no support of any kind. If I focused my career, that'd mean taking an MA, having to work part-time to make ends meet, so forget about saving money to go to the US or anything like that. And that's only the beginning, then I'd have to find an entry level job that pays barely enough, then get some sort of stability and **then** I'd get the financial stability to do what I want to do...",AskMen,1459870313,ads8888,22,11,True,2016-04-05

What's the best way to give notice to an employer?,"I'm apparently rewording this to avoid the spam filter.

I've worked for a company for almost 2 years and they've treated me well. I start a fantastic job on the 25th. I had planned to give notice yesterday once I got the paperwork. That would have left me roughly the week of the 18th as a mini vacation in between jobs.

The issue is that my current employer is based in Chicago and they sent three people for whatever reason to our tiny satellite office till Thursday. We don't have enough cubicles, so my boss said I need to work from home.

I was trying to salvage the week remaining in between jobs by putting in notice today, however the commute is 45 minutes away and I already have to take my drug test at lunch.

My options are to drive in tomorrow and kill almost 2 hours of drive time during business hours, call my boss today, or wait till Thursday. If you guys were in my position, what would you do? 

Edit: Okay maybe I made this confusing. The question is that my employer has been good to me. I have an email set up REGARDLESS of my decision.

On May 6th, my son leaves for Air Force basic training, and I've been quietly working on recording videos of myself talking, and giving advice on all manner of subjects. I'm trying to stick to topics that aren't already covered by thousands of books, websites, etc.

Please feel free to opine about any of the topics below, or suggest a topic.

How to: 

- Go on a date

- Kiss

- Know if she is ""the one"".

- Be the new guy at work

- Survive and have fun at a rough bar

- Bet on cards (with lots of warnings)

- Have a one-night stand (not how to make one happen, but rather, if he wants to do that, how to make it as safe, and as drama free as possible)

- Be in a fight

- Buy a car

- Tie a tie, and other rules and tips for dressing up.

- Speed and not get caught (or at least minimize the risk)

- Drive long distances.

- Buy food on a budget

- How to choose a career

- How to serve in the military (He is joining the Air Force in a month)

My (25M) parents are probably going to be going through a divorce. Can I get any insight from other adult children of divorce on what to expect?,"My dad is sometimes a huge asshole. I think that this is an objective, rather than subjective, fact. I guess it's becoming either more frequent or more unbearable for my mom. Today she confided in me that she's thinking about divorcing him. He knows this and isn't taking it extremely well, but wants her to make a decision. 

I don't live with them (my younger sister, 21, does. She has some depression issues and I'm very worried about her as well). 

I just don't really know what to expect. I'm not really sure what I'm even looking for posting, can I just hear from someone whose been here before? What should or shouldn't I do? I want to try to stay fairly neutral, although I do have a far better relationship with my mother.

How do you fellows deal with jealousy in a relationship?,"My girlfriend, of two months, has a group of friends, approximately 10 of mixed gender, she met through college club about a month ago. Last week she spoke about an event they went to where multiple club met up for a bunch of assorted mini-games. During the lunch break they slipped away (about 6 of them) to find a quiet place to chat. They ended up playing truth or dare. Initially she said that it got pretty crazy. When I asked her what made it crazy, she initially refused to tell me anything. Upon further pressing, simply because she's usually pretty happy to share small stuff so I found it unusual, she became upset and said that nothing had happened and that said that she had only said that so her story would be interesting. I grudgingly accepted this answer but I felt it did not make logical sense. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think she's doing anything that would be considered a deal but I honestly can't help it, the fact that I'm feeling jealous means that it isn't possible for me to take on an unbiased view in situations.

How do I deal with this? Do I just have to swallow it up?

"How do I not seem like ""that"" guy at Yoga Class?","I would ask this at Askwomen but they have no relationship Monday and the info to my queston msy break that rule. I also don't like asking them questions there lol.

Anyways, I've wanted to try yoga since last year but there was nowhere close that fit my schedule or i wasn't motivated enough to take the bus downtown. 

I just found out that my university offers yoga/meditation sessions and all i gotta do is show up. I've already started meditating but Yoga would be new. 

I want to start doing Yoga for two reasons: I'm starting to work out Wednesday and Friday and I think Yoga would be a good Monday routine and i want to meet some girls who are more likely to share something in common with me.

It seems like there is a view on guys who go to Yoga that they *only* want to find girls to date or hook up with. It'd be nice if that happens, but if it doesn't i will still attend the sessions.

I (27M) have had a pretty terrible attitude towards relationships (and various other life decisions) my whole life and it's now starting to catch up. What can I do to fix it?,"I'm not one for ""just doing"" something. If I can't meticulously plan something and then execute it to perfection I typically don't bother doing it. To quote David Foster Wallace, ""If your fidelity to perfectionism is too high you'll never do anything"". Somehow this has got me through life without any issues, but when it comes to relationships it's now causing me problems.

I have always been introverted and perfectly fine with my own company. Going down the pub with friends on a weekly (sometimes bi-weekly) basis was sufficient. The problem is, now that I'm the age I am my friends are all in relationships. Kids, marriages, unsociable working hours and it's now making me feel like I'm being left behind.

As an example, when I was in school I never bothered asking out a girl I liked because I thought ""She'll be going to university and we'll have to break up so what's the point in going through it all?"" It seemed logical and in a weird way, still does (retrospectively at least). Of course, that was beneficial short term and I couldn't see the long term issues that would cause. Another example is a girl from work a few years ago apparently had a thing for me. I knew she wanted kids so I thought ""I don't want kids so eventually we'd have to break up so what's the point?"" I'm sure you can see where this is going.

Cut to the present day and I have absolutely no relationship experience and it is almost making me want to avoid pursuing them because of the embarrassment of somebody having to be the first girl I go out on a date with. I can't help but think that at this stage in life there is a requisite level of experience necessary. Without it, surely questions will be raised. I have perfectly reasonable reasons for it (ridiculous, but not unreasonable, correct me if I'm wrong) and I like to think that at the very least acknowledging them will have some value. But is a girl really going to be interested in a guy that has no experience and no idea what to do?

Despite me acknowledging my flaws it still doesn't remove them. One of my friends said about setting me up with a girl he knows. ""Great"", I thought. He seemed to think we'd get on well together but I'm still hesitant because that old mentality of ""What if I make a mess of it"" keeps creeping back in. I don't care if she wants kids at this point, I don't care if it doesn't last and I don't care how long it lasts, but at the same time I don't want her to feel like she's simply being used for my own personal development. That's not how it is because I wouldn't want to waste her time or mine, but would it come across that way? I hope not.

How to feel about a rejection,"I am currently in university and have literally done nothing with a girl before other than hug. It's getting to the age now where I feel embarrassed. I've always treated girls as equals so I've never been shy around them socially but I've always been 'friendzoned' very quickly, which I've never really minded because I haven't been looking for anything. I think its also worth noting I am very social and I'm fairly average looking.

However, a few months ago I actually started falling for someone for the first time. We met up a few times, went on some walks and texted etc. Today I finally plucked up the courage (via text, because I'm a wuss at heart) to tell her that I liked her and, well, I got a disappointing response. 

She replied along the lines of 'That's sweet, I never knew you liked me in that way, I'm blushing, and that the thought of being more than friends with anyone ""freaks me out a little"".'

As far as I see it that's entirely fair, but its still a bit of a punch to the gut when I've become as attached as I have. My question is just how to feel about a 'rejection'? How do you move on? What do I do next? Do I feel disheartened that the first time I had enough courage to tell someone I liked them I got turned down or happy in the knowledge I tried? I really don't know what to feel because I was convinced she would feel the same way, silly me!

I look intimidating. How can I change my face?,"When my face is **relaxed**, I look intimidating. I also may look disinterested with everything, serious and focused. I basically look mean. Not energetic mean, but a bit lifeless mean.

&lt;more context&gt;

I was quite surprised when I realized that my face look mean in its natural state. It was when I used lens first time in my life. As a solution, people always tell me to smile. But you can't keep a smile on your face constantly because you cannot think about smiling constantly. I'm still a college student so for example, I forget to smile when I'm thinking, studying and in lectures. So even though I smile when I'm talking with people or when I make eye contact, it does not matter because people think that I'm not someone to be friends with because I look intimidating or something in my natural state. Let's be honest, people want to stay away from those who look bad. I'm unapproachable even though I'm average looking. My friends are from my childhood. Friends I make now in college are more like coworkers. 

I certainly will die alone, without friends or a partner, if I don't do something about this. 

Another aspect of ""looking mean"" is behaviour: Childhood insecurities and bullying led me to be defensive and look serious. One thing led to another. Here I am. Such a small thing effects your life in a huge way. 

I don't have anxiety but I try to avoid social interactions because I fear that I'll fuck up. I was quite social and talkative before bullying, before age of 12. I might even be a very extrovert person trapped inside introvert shell. But if I let myself out now, I'd look like a 15 years old extrovert trapped inside a body of 25 years old. Or I'd look too weird. Maybe you didn't notice but people constantly improve, optimize and balance their way of reacting, sayings, vocabulary, perspectives, body language among other things with each social experience. I lack quite a few years of them. So I hide in my shell when I can :)

&lt;/more context&gt;

I'm even up for surgery.

Male friend doesn't seem to respect me any more. Not sure what to do about it.,"I've known this core group of friends for well over a decade. Most of them are married by now and most of the spouses are now part of the core group. I think that we will be friends unto the grave. 

Except over the past year or two, one of the friends has been giving me this cold shoulder of disdain treatment. He hasn't said anything outright but he refuses to be engaged in a conversation and his body language suggests that he doesn't like me very  much. 

I may be projecting but I don't think I am. Our relationship with one another is subsumed into the greater group and the rest of them still treat me with the same level of friendliness. 

I'm not sure what to do. Call him out and try to talk with him one on one? Or just ignore it and maintain peace in the friend circle? I'm leaning towards option two, because I've got no proof and the guy in question is very non-confrontational.

Unfortunately I'm not getting anywhere online and I have attempted to contact over a 100 women and not a single one wants to even talk to me in the slightest. I managed to however get a block from one girl (not sure why though I think it's because we are different races), and a few rejection messages but that's it.

As for the content of my messages they are basically just me telling them I like their profile we got similar interests and I'd like to chat. No sexual or odd things.

How do you regains someone's trust after lying to them?,"So me and this dude have had an ""open relationship"" for about half a year. During this time I have developed feelings to where I don't feel the need/ have an interest in talking to other dudes. But, since we are in an open relationship, I would talk to a dude across the country hoping that it would make the situation feel better. Well, one day he asked if I talked to other dudes and for some reason I said no. But he found out and said he lost feelings because I'm a liar, and hat something could possibly happen in the future but I have to prove myself. I know time is really the only thing that helps but what else can I do? I really care about this man and want to work things out.

My boyfriend has been low self esteem lately. What has helped you grow confidence in tough times?,"In short my partner is dealing with a lot of stress at work and potentially switching jobs, which has led to some weight gain (he was heavy growing up but then lost a lot after high school), and has resulted in tension between us. 

I walk with him almost every evening he is home and suggest we cook healthy meals together. I tell him I find him attractive (and demonstrate it). I offered to help with the jobs but he told me he didn't want to bother me and I wasn't his job coach. I told him that even when we don't see eye to eye it doesn't make him a bad boyfriend or impact my love.

He seems to define himself a lot by the job and job prospects but his value to me as a person doesn't come from that. He said he still feels like the fat kid, but that really isn't and hasn't been the case for years despite the most recent gain.

I am considering suggesting he see a therapist to learn some copi g strategies but I am not sure how to bring it up.

What has helped you gain confidence? Was there anything your SO did that got you through tough and low self esteem times?

Guys: How long would it take you to know your SO had changed for the better?,"Ok, guys. Here's the situation. I have been with my SO (31/M) for a little under a year. I care about him deeply but I think my insecurities these last few months have altered our relationship. A little background: He is my first serious, this could have a future relationship. We started dating and he was way more into me than I was to him. He was getting out of a divorce and that worried me so I kept my distance. Once that ended and things leveled out, I fell hard for him and my insecurities took over. Started worrying about his ex and his feelings for me, that he would leave, the honeymoon stage was sort of naturally waning and I freaked thinking it meant he wasn't that into me, took everything he said and did super personally. Basically became needy and needed constant validation from him; lost my confidence and became everything I hate from a rational standpoint.

Anyways, I realize how wrong this was to put on him now and how these are my issues and not his. I get that I messed up and need to do some backtracking (just to be clear, he has not said this to me outright and has been super amazing dealing with my crazy) But now that I get this and know I need to slow my roll and just enjoy our relationship, I worry I have ruined the chance for him to see me and our relationship as long term without the drama.

So I have some here to ask you guys: what would make you know your SO had changed for the better? How long would it take? Would it even matter after you had the idea in your head that she was drama or insecure?

TL;DR; I messed up and was way too insecure with my SO. I want to change but am afraid I've ruined things long-term.",AskMen,1453395661,danak1313,17,11,True,2016-01-21

That shtick you see on a lot of marriage and family sitcoms about the man doing something bad and the wife forcing him to sleep on the couch as a punishment has always baffled me. Unless you cheated on her or did something that completely trashed the relationship and you're just waiting until you can move out or get divorced I don't get why any man would agree to sleep on the couch. 

In my head I would say ""I know you're mad at me but there's no way I'm not sleeping in my own bed, if you want to stay in there with me I have no problem but I am just not going to do the couch thing.""

Edit: I appreciate all the answers, just for clarity's sake I am only asking about sleeping on the couch because you're in the doghouse, not because you got sick or couldn't sleep or snore etc.

But that brings something up. Why didn't those male celebrities also get a Prenuptial Agreement?  Had to be a reason that even they didn't do it. They have money for legal advice from the best personal lawers, who would have likely suggested it unless there was a bad side to it that they told them to no do it.

"Guys, how do you honestly feel about women who have a penis size preference?","I am curious to hear your experiences and thoughts.

I keep seeing threads on reddit where people say ""size doesn't matter"" and ""just use your fingers, intercourse isn't important"" and I can't take them seriously.

As a woman I have a lot of girl friends and we all pretty much have the same penis size preference... Not too big or too small. Between 5.5-7 inches in length and thick is the preference. 

I'm not saying this applies to all women, of course. Many women want smaller men and many want bigger men, but in my experience my preference is probably average among women.

If a guy has a really small penis I can't fault him for wanting to learn other ways to please his lover... It's only natural. 

At the same time I wouldn't be with a guy who is over 7 inches because it would be uncomfortable and not enjoyable.

Knowing how to go down on her and finger her is awesome, but for myself and lots of other women that just isn't enough.

Having his penis inside my vagina giving me pleasure feels really special. His intimate part is inside my intimate part and it makes me feel more connected. 

The problem is that I see a lot of guys who call women who actually want to *feel* their partner's penis inside them ""size queens"", or say that they must have larger/looser vaginas.

I don't really understand this. Is it so offensive/such an insult for a woman to want to feel her man's penis inside her?

How would you prefer to be broken up with?,"Obligatory ""this is a general question but here's why I'm asking it"" explanation: 

* Been on four dates spanning a little less than a month. He asked if we could be exclusive on the last one, and I said yes.

* Less than 24 hours later: *I've made a huge mistake.*

* We've both gone home for Christmas break, so I'm not going to have the chance to see him for over a month now.

* He goes to a different uni, meaning that the only reason he would drive the ~30 minutes to my town would be to see me.

* I don't want to be a dick and do it via text or Facebook (or God forbid, snapchat), but is that the best option here? Would you mind if a girl broke up with you over the phone if it saved you some petrol money? 

Basically, I'm struggling with the when and how of this whole thing. Do I invite him out for coffee? But how would that even work - Would I do it after we finish our coffee? While we drink our coffee? In front of the coffee shop? Imagine driving half an hour only to be broken up with the moment you step out of your car.

I can't do it after a dinner or lunch date because he always insists on paying and I would look like such a twat to break up with him right after he bought me food.

Movie date? But how does one break up with someone on a movie date? ""We should see other people. Starting right now. I'm seeing Star Wars and you're seeing Alvin &amp; the Chipmunks. We can still be friends, right?""

And there's no way we can just casually bump into each other on the street because he only comes to my uni when we hang out.

This is such a shallow question, but I'm at my wit's end. Please help. ",AskMen,1450761755,_pancaste_,19,3,True,2015-12-21

"Men, how do I deal with my housemate who I have been friends with for 15 years, transpire into a total failure?","If this is the wrong sub for it sorry.

I am 31 and have known this friend (referred to as M) since high school. M has always been a bit apathetic and bitter towards life, but when he was younger he still had more of a sense of humour and drive. We were both angsty teenagers but I grew out of it many years ago and he never changed.

These days his usual routine is to wake up around 2pm, have some cereal and play PC games all day. The only time he leaves his room is to go to the toilet, get some food, smoke cigarettes or walk to the shops. M's hygiene is below average, he never contributes to cleaning the house (even though he never leaves it as he was made redundant earlier this year) and he never ever has anything positive to say.

He is lazy as hell and it really pisses me off but I also know he is depressed. I'm not going to bother getting into the backstory of his life but there was a bit of neglect on his parents side and some abuse from his brother (lots of fighting between them). M's depression, which probably fuels his social anxiety, is part of the explanation for his totally apathetic view of the world and crushing negativity. He has zero confidence and no sense of initiative to get out there, set goals and hit achievements.

However the biggest problem with M's personality, is his ridiculous sense of pride. This man will never admit that there might be a problem with his world view or his attitude. His parents sent him to multiple psychologists as a child and he thought they were all idiots. I once suggested mindfulness meditation to him and he laughed in my face. According to him, It's not that he has a total lack of confidence to speak to a girl, it's that he isn't interested (and I know he is). His pride is a defense mechanism that he uses to justify his unhappy, stagnant existence.

I (and other mutual friends) have tried over and over to give him a bit of a helpful push throughout the years. We include him in our social events and try to push him in the right direction. I try to get him to exercise with me and get him excited about a new job or travelling overseas. He can be amicable at times, however he always goes back to his shitty habits and pisses his life and health away smoking cigarettes and playing PC all day and night not speaking to anyone for days at a time.

Now because of (circumstances), I and another housemate are living with M. We are both friendly with M but in reality my opinion of him is very low. I don't think he realises how toxic and detrimental his attitude towards life is on the people that have to be near him. I would love if there was something I could do to give him some hope and motivation in life but there really is nothing I haven't tried that he's either given up on or laughed at me for suggesting.

Am I being too harsh a judge of character or no? What am I supposed to do with this friend? Every year I draw closer to the friends I've known for this long but with him it is the opposite.",AskMen,1450781424,StiffyAndy,39,36,True,2015-12-22

Whats the right thing to do here? Hear me out,"Kind of a complicated situation and something i feared when i took on the relationship. Currently with my gf for 2 yrs almost but when we started it was basically a rebound. She was on/off with her ex for few months then we got intimate and couldnt stop our chemistry. Things are great and were in love but for past yr her job makes her work 60hrs a week and she travels so we only have weekends. It gets hard when one weekend we have separate things to do or if she wants a trip w friends or if i wanna do something with my friends. But were both honest with each other. We had long talk today cuz i was a bit disappointed with lack of attention due to her work. She also mentioned she feels like she missed out on single life goin from one relationship to another and she doesnt want a ""break"" but at the same time I understand and always feared that when we hooked up but when it's happening youre so in love and having a good time that youre like ffuck it and go for it. Well fast forward 2 yrs and im faced with a tough situation. I dont want to make her make a decision cuz thatll cause problems later maybe but at the same time i cant do a ""break"" cuz im not dumb i know thats pretty much a break up and itll never work.

Am I leading my gay friend on?,"So my friend, who is gay, pretty obviously has a (what I thought was *small*) crush on me. Everyone in our friend group knows it and he doesn't exactly hide it. Not only that, when it's brought up he doesn't deny it. Just kind of laughs and jokes along. I've never though it was a huge deal, I thought it was kind of funny, and honestly it never seemed like something he even took seriously. but he said something the other day that bugged me. 

Anyways, I spend quite a bit of time with him. He's a really good friend despite not knowing him that long. We hang out 3+ nights a week, talk about pretty much everything and just enjoy each other's company. We joke around A LOT and occasionally we ""flirt"" but it's always in a joking manner, and is stuff I would say and do with my straight friends

The other night we were getting drunk together and even though we were sitting right next to each other, he snap chatted me a picture of my crotch and said ""I want this"". I laughed it off as a jokey flirt, but then after a little bit more of that he looked at me and said ""you've gotta stop teasing me man"". That bugged me because I don't really act different around him so idk what I'm doing. He also told me that he would have sex with me in a heart beat. He was drunk and doesn't remember it but still

I talked to our very close mutual friend (F18, I have a sexual history with her and he knows this) and she said that his crush is obvious. Apparently he's mentioned it to her but not in depth. She told me when he looks at me she sees a deep desire in his eyes. I'm not sure what to make of that. Like I said, he's told me that he wants me and I know he means it but he also knows I am straight so I don't think he expects anything. I've told him I'm not gay and that's not changing anytime soon. 

Anyways idk what to do. I can't control his feelings, and I've told him that I am straight and it won't happen. He says it's fine and that he likes our friendship. But I feel like all the time I spend with him and the joking flirtatiousness is causing him pain. I'd stop but I feel like that would just throw off the entire dynamic of our friendship and make it awkward. I don't want to lose him as a friend but I dot want to lead him on. I've been led on before and I know it hurts. Advice? 

I am 20 and he is 18

EDIT: for clarification, all of our flirting was a joke. I do it with straight friends too. I had always thought he was joking as well until recently when he told me he actually wants me when we were drinking. I never flirted with him with the intention of fucking with his feelings.

What was the biggest life-changing experience you've had so far?,"I'm a college senior, and strangely enough, the biggest/best life-changing experience I've had so far was working full-time. At the beginning of the summer of 2015, I was feeling lost, and had no idea what I was going to do both in the short/long run. I was at home in my super-rural New Jersey town, and desperately wanted to find SOMETHING to do other than sit at home all day. I had done the whole chill at home thing for an entire summer before, and was not willing to go back to that lifestyle. For the first two weeks of summer, I basically just chilled with friends, talking about our fears and concerns for the future. 

All of a sudden, I got a call from the department manager of a company I applied to, asking me to become a member of her team. This company is actually one of the biggest and most successful corporations in the world, so I was stoked to actually get an offer. Not to mention, they were actually offering to pay me a lot during the summer, so it was a dream come true. In the next week, I managed to find a one-bedroom apartment in a prime location (5 min drive away from work, 5 min walk away from grocery store and restaurants, 5 min drive away from two different towns with bars/shops/etc, 2 min drive away from the beach) all for myself. 

I started work very soon after. The work I was doing wasn't particularly difficult, but my team held me to a very high standard from the start and weren't afraid of calling me out on my mistakes. It was really stressful adjusting to the fast-paced environment at first, and I often got chewed out for screwing up. In the meantime, I would force myself to go out and explore my new area, which was two hours away from home. There was plenty to check out -- bars, restaurants, parks, numerous beaches, and I basically had somewhere new to go to every day after work. I also worked on meeting new people, since I didn't know a single soul. 

It really sucked for the first month and a half of summer, since I both struggled at work and also was lonely without friends. But as soon as I got ahold of my job and got to know some of my coworkers better, things really started to pick up. Now everyone in my work started to like me a lot more, plus I felt a lot more confident with my abilities. I hung out with my coworkers more often, and even became bold enough to chat up girls on the beach. On weekends, I would go on adventures, either into New York City, or on roadtrips hundreds of miles away. 

Two months in, I was living the dream, and didn't want the summer to end. I was making enough money to do anything I wanted, well-liked among my coworkers, and overall breaking out of my comfort zone in ways I never could have imagined. I was having some of the craziest experiences of my life, doing stuff that the previously shy and reserved me could never have seen myself doing. I was learning my strengths and weaknesses, and realizing my true potential. 

The last day of work was one of the saddest days of my life. I was going back to school in a few days, but I desperately wanted to stay at work, and continue all the learning I've undergone the summer. Packing all my stuff away, saying good-bye to all my coworkers, walking through the glass doors of my building for the last time... damn it hit me hard. I feel like this summer has changed me profoundly for the better in making me a stronger, more sociable, and independent person. Now I feel like wherever I end up after college, I'm confident I'll be able to survive. 

Now that I'm back at school, it's like nothing in college can ever live up to what I've done this summer. Have any of you had similar experiences that really had a profound impact on your life?

What could be the possible arguments in favor of forgiving someone who cheated on you?,"I'm not in a current relationship and my love history consists mostly of friendzones and hookups. I don't have a good experience in being in a relationship, yet somehow I have this premade judgement that if I ever get cheated on, I would not react like 99% of reddit here and dump my girlfriend right away. I hope from this you can tell it's self-evident that I've never cheated on someone as well.

And so I'm looking for rational arguments in favor of that (other than ""it's because I've never experienced it).

So far, I just feel that if they don't want to be with me then they can leave me, and if they do they can stay. I want to live in a monogamous exclusive relationship (thus, getting cheated on once can pass for me, but twice I would break up then), so I would ask my (hypothetical for now) girlfriend to make up her mind and choose a side. The reason why she cheated would be extremely important as well. Does our relationship lack something? Can it be improved?

Some people here have a tendency to assume that cheaters are simply people who can't stop themselves from looking around instead of focusing on one partner. Well, then if that's the case how about this Stoic view that says that you should not react to things which are not under your control but only to those who depend on you. Since I don't own my girlfriend and she is not part of me, I should expect the possibility that she could end things up or do something that is against an exclusive monogamous relationship. I'm not saying I should expect this to happen. I'm saying I should assume this is one of the many possibilities that could happen in my life, and on which I have no control. And thus, I should only react to things that depend on me, such as the things that make my girlfriend attracted to me for instance (without being crazy; I can't obviously become superman or turn into someone I'm not).

Trust? Well I hardly see the problem of trust since she didn't use any of my weaknesses against me (or anything she knows about me towards me). What about my ""trust that she is dedicated to this relationship?"", then again we go back to the previous paragraph that I should expect this trust (more of an expectation) that this could happen.

My only problem that makes it harder to forgive cheating is in terms of hygiene and body. I don't know who she slept with (I actually don't care, I just don't know how clean that person is), and hygiene is something extremely important for me so I guess I just wouldn't have sex or kiss her right after you know.

So what do you think? Is it ever possible to forgive someone who cheats in a relationship?",AskMen,1449513096,Kikool42,37,9,True,2015-12-07

Ever find yourself unable to stop thinking about a female friend even though you think you shouldn't be into her?,"I'm 25, I've known this girl (24) (don't know her very well) for about a year. We hang out with the same large gaming group / ""club"" and have talked a decent amount over the past year, but nothing serious or anything. Truthfully, she only just learned my name a few weeks ago-- but she is awful with everyone's names, and often times most people call each other by their D&amp;D characters names.

She's been in and out of 3 relationships since I've known her, but I don't know many details of why they ended or anything like that. This is a bit  of a red flag for me. Additionally, she works multiple jobs (busy schedule) and doesn't seem to have many prospects for future earning. The former is definitely a negative and I haven't decided on the latter. I absolutely don't mind paying for dates, but I don't want to feel like I have to either.

I guess that, given she only just learned my name, she's most likely not interested in me and I should just forget it, but now that she's single again I'm wondering if I should give it a shot and ask her on a date.

Despite the flags, for some reason I can't stop myself from thinking about asking her out. I don't know if I just need to get laid (it's been a while), if I'm genuinely interested, if I'm just looking for reasons to *not* pursue her (I'm not exactly the healthiest person mentally). Additionally, hypothetically, say she actually said yes and things go OK. If and when they go south, could be awkward if I wanted to continue hanging out with the D&amp;D group. I initially joined solely to make friends and meet people, so it'd kind of suck to lose the closest thing I have to friends beyond my roommates. I don't hang out with anyone there beyond the one or two days per week the group gets together and I don't often talk with any of them much outside the get-togethers, either.

"Shy &amp; awkward guys, how should I show interest in you?","I'm a shy &amp; awkward women that is majorly into a shy &amp; awkward guy friend. We recently started hanging out alone (we previously only hung out in a group setting with mutual friends) after I invited him to the movies. He's awkwardly asked me to the movies twice and I've awkwardly asked him to the movies twice. We always get dinner after the movies &amp; just walk around the city and talk. The word date has never been mentioned. As far as I know, he doesn't normally hang out with female friends alone. Nothing romantic ever happens during our hang outs but I do notice that we both get a little shy/reserved when it's just us alone as opposed to how we act in a group setting. I want to make a move but I'm too scared of rejection. Hell, just asking him to the movies made me want to puke from nerves. We're both somewhat inexperienced in the romance dept. (me more so than him) despite being older (we're both in our early 30s) and I can be so awkward when it comes to anything romantic. I can't tell if he is interested in me as well. So I come asking for advice. I don't want to freak him out by coming on too strong. What can I do to show my romantic interest and not scare this guy?

"According to my friends, I can't 'handle the banter'. How do I, well, handle the banter better?","Okay, this thread was kind of prompted out of a party I went to last night.

Long story short, my friends told a girl who I hadn't met to try piss me off for the rest of the evening. They told her, to my understanding, that I 'get offended easily', and am generally defensive when too much banter goes on. To my understanding, they encouraged her to piss me off throughout the evening.

She called me retarded several times, said that I looked like ""Mr Bean's deformed brother"", and also insulted my lack of social skills.

I didn't retaliate, because I had never met this girl before: I knew nothing about her backstory, so I didn't know where I could go with potential jokes.

This continued until I left to get ready for work, which was the following morning. I went through at least six hours of non-stop insults being hurled at me.

Now, I realise that banter is just, well, *banter*: it's a joke, and it holds no grounds. But what bothers me about this situation is the fact that my friends told someone, who I didn't know, to insult me just to get a reaction out of me.

So, men of /r/askmen/: how do I handle the banter?

*EDIT: So the consensus seems to be a combination of: ""get some new friends that aren't dicks""; and ""This isn't banter, this is bullying"". As kind of an update, I had a chat to one of the friends who insinuated this. TL;DR: he apologised, and realised that he had fucked up. I need to talk to the other friend that was in this situation. Regardless, I'm going to start hanging out with other people.*

*I want these guys to be my friends, but this might've just killed my last ounce of confidence going forward. It's time that I learned to stand up for myself, too. This isn't banter, and this isn't the same as self-deprication. I blocked the girl who was being a cunt to me on Facebook, and I don't intend on hanging out with her or anyone she associates with.*

"Hey AskMen, how do I deal with being cut out of someone's life? Especially if I care a lot about them?","Backstory: I met a girl, who we'll call Sarah, back in late August randomly through a get together. She seems pretty cool and we exchange info and head our separate ways. I decide to chat her up a few days later and we actually click very well - I didn't expect this since we didn't talk *that* much, but it made things all the more enjoyable as we flirted and got closer. She's a few years younger than me, (I'm 22, she's 19) and within a few chats she drops a few bombs on me:

1. She is terminally ill
2. She has been trafficked as a child

I am a very open and giving person, but I'm cautious about people who give that info too soon so I took it with a grain of salt. We flirted and whatnot and eventually got together - it was a cheap first date and I offered to paid since it was such. We get back to her place and lo and behold, she shows all the signs of a person with this illness - hundreds of packets of pills that she must take in order to survive, and her work badge, which is for an organization against human trafficking - her specific designation is a ""survivor-advocate.""

Now this is where things get sticky - I realize that she's someone in need and, immediately, my giving side starts to go. I had already liked her before she told me so I decided to roll with (I understand that, from an outside perspective, this may look like a stupid and rash decision). Anyway, I take her out to dinners, adventures, and even a trip out to a different city, all paid by me because she had showed me her bank account, which stayed at 0 because she had to pay her medical bills (as I type this I feel more and more duped). However, she's always hanging out with her band members, because she loves music, and, being a social-media junkie, she always posts snaps of them having fun, and one kid especially, a guy we'll call John, is always pretty close to her and she's always kind up against him in these snaps. I have never received this type of attention from her - you'd think that she'd want to given the fact that she said she likes me and enjoys my company and wants to take things slow. So over time, I get distrustful. She apparently always has a packed schedule too, so she's always hit or miss when it comes to responding/hanging out, but then I'll often see snaps of her and her band going out partying or just hanging out (especially with this John guy) - and I'll confront her about it. She says not to worry, but our conversations always dry up and it always reverts to the next time I can take her out somewhere (which I'm not excited about anymore because I can't open up comfortably to someone I don't really think is being sincere, and especially if I'm paying). So two weeks ago, she says she might have time for a date on a Friday; I decide to call her 2 days later to confirm, so I can make reservations, and, of course, she doesn't pick up (it's 8 pm btw) so I leave a message, albeit a little passive aggressive because I'm tired from work and this whole charade. She catches on and texts to question my tone, and I explain that it's difficult to be excited when someone wouldn't take 30 seconds to confirm for a reservation for 2 days away (especially since we've now ""seen"" each other for over 2 months). She explodes, cancels everything, tells me that she's disgusted by my clingy relationship paranoia and that she has plenty of other priorities in her hard life. I immediately recoil and suggest that we both take a moment because we're hotheaded and, first, explained myself, and, second, sincerely apologized - no excuses just ""I'm sorry for hurting you."" She calms down a bit and says she feels manipulated and needs space. I don't really contact her save for one snapchat in the next week. She texts later with a cryptic ""Pray for me,"" a week later, which I respond with sympathy, and that's the end of contact. I believe I'm cut off now - how do I cope?

Even though I'm finding my work and studies fulfilling, the grind is getting to me and I think it's the loneliness that's doing it.

Just wanted to stop by and ask y'all something unabashedly.

I'm just curious about this, as I'm about to make my first foray into the world of dating and I am a little apprehensive, not knowing what to expect and all. I'm of Indian ethnicity, but born and brought up in the good ol' USA.

I thought I'd garner some perspectives from men who have possibly had experiences dating Indian women to get an idea of what awaits me. I'd really appreciate it if you guys could perhaps answer the following three questions for me:

1) Do you like Indian women?

2) What kind -- the Bollywood siren ([like her](http://imgur.com/vEXhDDr)) or the Exotic goddess ([like this beauty](http://imgur.com/BHzGMsL))? Or some other type?

3) If you like Indian women, do you prefer them to women of other ethnic groups?

4) Have you dated one in the past/are dating one currently/would like to date one? Would you consider a LTR with one?

5) What is your ethnicity?

Please humor me here, if not for my sake, then for the sake of science ;p

Signed,

Inquisitive Indian Woman ;)

I'm not entirely sure what I should do for my kids. I don't bathe, change, or help them in the bathroom because to my wife and I that's weird but apparently this is a dad thing to do.

My measurements are 39"" bust, I wear 34F, my waist is 28"" and my ass is 43,"" I'm also 5""1.

Recently ended a 4 year relationship. I have no sex drive and performance issues. How can I deal with this?,"Hey guys. I'm a 22 year old college student. I've recently been struggling with this issue and it is taking a toll on me. Before I broke up with my gf of 4 years, I had a crazy high sex drive. It was one of the reasons our relationship did not work. She was practically asexual. I would jack off once a day every day (probably pretty average for most folks) and I was always DTF. Never had any issue staying hard, and had great stamina and self control.


The breakup was mutual, we were not in love anymore and our relationship was not good. We both knew it was for the best and moved on with our lives. I rarely think about her and have been staying busy (school, work, gym 3 times a week, tennis on the weekends)


We broke up 4 months ago and since then my sex drive has diminished significantly. I jack off maybe twice a month. I've had issues staying hard when in sexual situations with this new girl I'm seeing. It's like my mind is just not in the moment. 


Last night I was going to have sex with her and I could not for the life of me get an erection. We both went down on each other but no luck. It REALLY bothered me. I know its probably a psychological issues. Maybe it's the fact that I was super comfortable with my ex and don't really know this new girl as well (although weve been dating a month which I feel is plenty of time)

"Do you find it easier or harder to date a girl you're already spending time with for other reasons? (Uni, work, volunteering, etc)","Ok, so I'm not sure how to explain this, but I'll do my best.  

Recently I [M22] gave up on online dating: I had my share of luck with it, but it's just not for me, mainly because I love meeting a girl, looking at her eyes, movements, whether she laughs at my jokes, all those things help me understand if I like her and if she likes me. With online dating we often have to text for days/weeks before we meet and it's a lot of effort for a girl I might not like IRL or doesn't like me (pictures are not enough)  

I also struggle when I get a girl's number in some other situation (event, common friends, nightclub, etc) and then I have to text her/call her etc, so it becomes basically a virtual thing until we see each other again.  

Then I realised it's always been easier for me to build attraction* when I was already spending time with her for other reasons, volunteering together for example: I find it way easier and way better. I feel like I'm actually building something, and there's loads of small signals that you can pick up to understand if it's going well, instead of having to text and almost beg to get a date.  

So, do you feel the same way? Or are you completely fine with texting and maybe prefer not having to see her regularly for other reasons?

I'm a very positive person and get along with about 95% of the people I work with.

There are numerous other reasons that I will bake something or bring in treats from a bakery - somebody leaving, someone having a bad week etc. I do this equally for guys and girls.

I found out this week that there are rumors that I am romantically interested in three different guys at work (two of which no longer work there). The reason being, I baked something or did something nice for each of their birthdays. I'm flabbergasted. I have no romantic interest in any of them - they are all married and I attended all of their weddings. I actually consider them all good friends. Now I don't know what I feel.

AskMen - My girlfriend doesnt necessarily like the activity my guy friends and I engage in.what should I do?,"Hi Guys, so i have recently started dating a girl. we have been together for 4 months now and things are going pretty well. this last week I introduced her to some of my friends for the first time. 
so a little background info, my friends and I are into smoking weed. it is one of our favorite past times and usually we end up playing basketball and smoking up afterwards, kind of like a ritual. Now this time I took my girl with me to smoke up with them and she didnt smoke up though but sat with us while we did. 
afterwards i find out that she didnt like it at all and said that she didnt feel safe at all and that if we got caught we would be in so much trouble and she would be in trouble as well( i live in a country where its life imprisonment for weed). and then she started crying because she said she didnt feel like she could relate to my friends at all because she couldnt have a onversation with either of them since we were stoned and talking random stuff. She said that its not that she doesnt like my friends, she just doesnt like the activity we do.i am torn now. because i really love her but i love my friends as well. now i agree that this habit of smoking weed has gotten to the point where my friends and i if we hang out, there is always weed so its like we cant hang out without weed. this maybe a problem for us as well because its becoming a habit.which is what she pointed out. how can i go about solving this problem?",AskMen,1444283452,chevychase0904,30,0,True,2015-10-07

Secretly hiring an escort for a hopeless virgin friend?,"We were debating this among a group of friends. We decided to NOT go for it, for now, but I'm curious about what AskMen would have done.

I've got a friend who is a hopeless virgin. He has never kissed a girl and his only relationship was long distance and online, and ended badly. The only girl he has ever chased in real life rejected him and he took it quite badly. He has expressed his frustration many times, and has subtly asked us to introduce him to friends of ours, and we have, but they don't seem to pay any attention to him.

Our plan was to hire an escort and go out all of us one night and tell her to hook up with him. She wouldn't be the only girl, of course, some would bring their GFs and others would bring friends with them, to make it look less suspicious. She would be introduced as some girl one of us met the previous day, who happens to be in town but is leaving the next day.

We were hoping that by doing this he would feel better about himself, his self-esteem would improve significantly and therefore he would become more successful with girls, but of course there's the ethical dilemmas.",AskMen,1444284270,1sttimepleasebgentle,37,1,True,2015-10-07

However I was away on a trip a couple of weeks ago, and when I came home I found out that my wife had cybersex with a guy she met on a gaming site. She told me it meant nothing to her, but still i felt really hurt and betrayed. She has never done this kind of thing before and was not something I thought she could do. I'm thinking she's been cheating on me, but she doesn't consider it to be that and thinks I'm overreacting. Then I find out she had been googling all info she could about the guy, even going as far as trying to find his phone number (she was logged onto my computer with my google account, so the searchhistory was there open wide, I wasn't trying to check on her or anything). She still says it didn't mean nothing to her, and i tell her in no uncertain terms that I don't want her to have contact with the guy.

We are basically best friends at this point who hook up like once a week or so. I wouldn't care so much if he wasn't so flirtacious with everyone, especially a mutual friend who takes ego boosts on the thought that he wants to fuck her and will be really forward and cuddle and what not.

How would you feel if a girl opened a first date with a hug?,"Assume you met through online dating and this is your first time meeting in person.

I run into a lot of problems with awkwardness when dating, both on my side and on men's. I read that giving the guy a platonic hug at the start of the date can help reduce awkwardness by establishing (at least on my side) that touch and closeness are okay. My first thought after reading that was ""That makes a lot of sense, but it sure sounds creepy."" Right now my thinking is that if it was the guy who asked for the date, I can feel safe assuming he likes me enough that he'd be happy if I hugged him, but I wouldn't feel safe assuming that if I was the one who initiated the date.

So, guys of /r/AskMen, what would you think of a girl who hugged you to introduce herself at the start of a first date? Would she seem creepy or desperate? Or might it make you think she was ""easy"" (please be honest on this one.)

Also, if you're from Toronto, could you please say so in your answer? I live in Toronto, and I've been told the dating culture here is unusually cold, so I'm especially interested in the opinions of guys from here.

"If your girlfriend posted on Gonewild without you knowing, would you be upset?","I came across a comment on another subreddit that got me thinking. Since I'm not allowed to link it and I'd rather not message the mods and get them on my bad side, I'll just explain the context: 

(Edit: not my GF, just explaining context) Girlfriend posts on GW saying that she will post herself there whenever she's mad at her boyfriend. GW commenters argue about whether or not she is essentially cheating on her BF. One comment said:

&gt;He doesn't own you, post whatever you want even when you're not mad at him.

On another subreddit discussing the controversy, this comment referenced the one above and how it was downvoted (-6):

&gt;On a sub built around dudes jacking off over stranger nudes. They have high standard for their porn. It must be published only with the permission of the supervising male. 

That one was upvoted (+18).

While I try my best not to be a sexist, I'd be upset if my girlfriend posted on Gonewild without even mentioning it first, especially if she did it because she was mad at me. I feel like she wouldn't be happy if I was sharing dick picks with the internet, but at the same time the phrasing in the comment made it sound pretty horrible to think that she needs permission. I'll be honest and say I at first was confident that the comment was BS, however seeing it upvoted bugged me making me think that I'm in the wrong, hence me posting here looking for either validation or a new point of view.

I've never lost a parent, and I don't pretend to know what he's going through.

Accidental Pregnancy Advice?,"A few months ago my gf at the time and I were fooling around, and things started to get a little x-rated. Soon enough I was getting a condom ready, and we proceeded to go on about it. Due to a number of factors, we didn't end up working out and we decided to amicably split about two months later.

Now fast forward to a week ago and I get a text from her when she hadn't contacted me for months, to ask a rhetorical question about what I'd do if I found out I got someone pregnant and she was considering adoption as the best solution. Would I want to know these people and have some contact, or would I be content to know that my child is in the hands of strangers?

This was phrased to me as a hypothetical, but I'm not an idiot, or at least I thought I wasn't. I'm absolutely terrified about what all this entails, as I'm only 19 and she's 18, and I don't want either of our lives to be impacted so greatly by a child neither of us can afford to give everything it needs and deserves. I agree that adoption is the best course of action, but I also don't know how to touch on the subject of abortion, just as an option. For the first time in my life I have absolutely no idea what to do and don't know who to talk to.

If there's anything that anyone can tell me about this, or how I can proceed in a manner that allows my ex, the baby, and myself to live our own lives I'd greatly appreciate it. Also, if there are any other subreddits I could post this to, just to get the most information, please let me know.

Have any of you guys developed general anxiety later in life?,"I'm a 21 year old student. Right now I'm in pretty tough classes but they are not overwhelming. I have ample time to study and do homework because I'm not working currently. My school was all paid for by scholarships (except for like $200) so I didn't have to worry about that.

Basically my life is pretty easy right now. I even go to the gym 3-4 times a week for weightlifting and swimming and I've started to eat healthier. 

But lately I've had generalized feelings of anxiety. I've felt anxiety before, but nothing like this. In the past, the anxiety I've felt would be about certain things like tests, funerals, etc. Now however, I just feel anxious and horrible all the time but it's not specifically about something. I get constant headaches, when I sleep I wake up every hour and I have trouble falling asleep, and my bowel movements have been less than consistent. 

I would go to my doctor but I'm worried he'll think I'm just trying to score drugs since I've never really had anxious symptoms before. 

So, have any of you men (or women) developed anxiety symptoms later in life and how did you deal with it?

We were in the same class in high school (it was like love in first sight when I first saw her), but I never told her how I feel. I was insecure.

In senior year, she started dating some guy. I was kinda jealous.

We were in the same class in University too. She eventually got engaged. She's been engaged for 5 years now.

Lately we've been hanging out a lot, as friends of course. But I feel like she likes me too. She does things like: takes selfies of us, suddenly likes my taste in music, asks me for movie recommendations, asks me to go on different events with her, sends me pictures of her while she's at work, last night she sent me a snap of her covered in a blanket... weird.

Her fiance seems to be comfortable with her hanging out with me.

What do I do? Do I tell her how I feel? Maybe she knows but I never told her with words. I'm afraid I will ruin the friendship if I say the three words. And I would feel kinda guilty if she breaks up with her fiance.

What's your experience with metal watch straps?,"We all now men's best friend after television and the dog, his watch. Probably the only jewellery every man on the planet can wear without looking strange.

I have a 26 year old watch with metal strap. It's a heirloom, looks manly, but it drives me crazy: Either the straps are too tight or too loose, the watch turns upside down or cuts into the flesh or the arm hair (I'm a wimp, I know).

But I am at work and that wouldn't be good. I didn't do it of course but this feeling is everyday. I don't feel like I'm depressed and yes I have bottled anger. Any insight on this would be great.

"Men, what are you like when dating just out of a relationship? How can this be made easier for you? What are some things to make it easier for myself?","As you may have guessed, I've started seeing a friend who just got out of a long-term, cohabiting, relationship. It was dying for a while, then his ex cheated and they broke up. It's been about a month since then. We've been talking/going on casual dates for a couple weeks. Apparently I like 'em vulnerable.

So far, things seem great, but he hasn't taken much time to himself. I want to make sure to move slow enough/give him enough distance that he has a chance to sort things out emotionally about his ex. Of course, I also don't want to go so slowly he stops seeing me as a romantic prospect (and I want to have sex with him, like, now - but I'm being patient). He's very much a romantic, monogamous kind of guy. Casual relationships aren't his thing. Doesn't mean this won't crash and burn though! Anyway, that's my situation and why I'm interested.

But, it's the generalities that I'm interested in! What are you like when you're dating after a LTR? Fall hard, pull out fast? Distant? How do you like your breakup to be handled? Ignored? And, for the particularly introspective, what are some red flags that show you may not be ready for dating yet?

Update: Dated this lovely man for 3 months, and then learned he had deep issues beyond just his ex. He is broken and so not ready for a relationship. Too bad, because if he were healthy he'd be such an amazing boyfriend.",AskMen,1443036340,loveethrow,46,12,True,2015-09-23

Recently single with an old flame that never panned out in the past potentially becoming single soon...advice? Long story incoming,"So I've been single about 3 months now for the first time in 3 years. Two nights ago ""Ashley"" calls me at about 3AM. Note that she is in a relationship at this punt. I am always up at this hour, so I answer. She seems kinda distressed, but is asking about me. I haven't talked to her in close to a year. She apparently heard that I broke up with my ex and asked about that. We talked for a bit and I asked if she was alright. She assured me she was, but said that she thinks she needs to break off her relationship. I don't dig too much for more detail. We talk, I make her laugh, etc, for almost half an hour before we decide we should go to sleep. I say we should catch up some time soon, she agrees, I say we'll talk soon, and we say good night.

Her and I have always had amazing chemistry. We make each other laugh, can talk for hours, etc. Any time she has been in my life in the past, I have been happier then comparable situations when she wasn't in my life.


The next day I text her making sure she is still ok and say that I was serious about seeing each other soon. She is going out of town this week, so we'll see what is up when she is back I guess. That is the tl;dr I guess, but I feel the backstory is important, so keep reading if you're interested.

I have known Ashley for about 10 years...since the start of high school. She is a year older than me. My freshman year we were acquaintances. My sophomore year we started to get close. She had a boyfriend, and I was a pussy, so I didn't do anything. Junior year it was clear she was into me, but I still never made a move, because she wasn't available. I went to her graduation party and didn't see her for about a year after.

Then I ran into her at a party at a mutual friend's house. We started getting close again, but she had a different boyfriend. I didn't make a move until a friend's going away party. We were kinda drunk, flirting was going on, and I kissed her. We made out, and went back to the party. Later that night she said she wanted to kiss me again, but I was collected and said I didn't want to do any more when she had a boyfriend.

A couple weeks later I was hanging with my buddy's watching Ip Man and drinking. I get a text from her. She says she is single. I meet her at my house and we have sex. For some reason nothing materialized.

A few months later I get my recent GF. Ashley and I still hang out as good friends for a bit, but then she gets a BF, and we kinda drift. I see her here and there when our friend host gatherings, but not often. We run into each other at the bar one night and have a conversation about ""us."" We decide that there will always be something there between us, but it currently doesn't seem like a realistic thing to happen.

Basically I currently want to hang out with her and see what happens. I have no plans of pressuring her to break up for me or anything like that. I wouldn't mind just being friends with her, because I really just like having her in my life, because we have a lot of fun together. I will have to judge where the encounter goes overall, but I would be willing to spill out my guts on where I stand, in terms of wanting her in my life in some capacity, because of how well we vibe and get along.

So yeah that is about the end of my ramblings, if anyone spent the time reading that, any responses of any kind are appreciated.",AskMen,1441693552,NotHannibalBurress,3,0,True,2015-09-07

"I am technically single, should I search other avenues yet? (Wedding This Weekend)","I will do my best to keep this quick.

Long story short my girlfriend of 2+ years broke it off about a month ago and it goes like this:

I appreciate you wanting to be with me and showing me all this love and I am sure if I would stay with you I would be happy for weeks and months to come, but there are potholes in our relationship that we keep patching that I don't think we will ever fix. I love you as a person and care about you a ton and I'm loosing more than a boyfriend but a best friend. I might be wrong in this but this is what I feel I have to do and that God has bigger plans for both of us. I just don't see us marrying each other in the future. There was a point I thought you were the one but I'm thinking not anymore.

We have hooked up twice last week and saw each other on Sunday to hang out and do homework together and I am still trying to figure out if I am being played or if she actually is trying to take things slow.  Last time I asked for her to recommit she ran away (not physically, but didn't talk to me for some time)  I have been trying to get her back since we broke up, but it gets exhausting chasing after someone who wont reciprocate back. 

I have a wedding to go to Saturday and I asked my ex, but she said no it would be too intense with some of my family there, but she doesn't care if I go with someone else and doesn't care who it is, she said go have fun with whoever you want.  Is this a trap?  Does she really not care?  Should I go stag before I start a war?  What do I do?

"Ok, might sound silly but...guys with big feet - where do you find fun/interesting socks?","This seems like such a small problem but after spending all day yesterday checking various stores, I'm still sock-less. 

Explanation: My SO has big feet. He wears a size 15 wide, and his feet are like comically wide. [For comparison his feet are somewhat like this](http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1561/firstclass4.png).  We were talking casually about accessories and I was asking about what kind of underwear he likes (I'm not terribly subtle about gift shopping), apparently he doesn't really care about that but let slip that he always wanted a pair of socks that wasn't boring. All of his socks are very plain (solid black, brown or white) as he just gets the largest pack of cheap socks he can find (which often still end up being stretched too thin and wear out super quickly). 

So I thought, sweet, this will be a relatively cheap and easy thing I can give him. I looked around online at first at socks with patterns/images I thought he'd like, but all of them would be too small....they seem to be mostly made for size 8-10 or 10-13 (and that latter category itself is hard to find). When I try searching for extra large socks all I can find are the practical brown/black/white work socks he already owns. 

This seems like a silly problem (and ok, it is) but seriously, where are all the cool socks for big footed men?? I'm not looking for anything crazy - I started off looking for something with like, [sharks](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQAjwnRiIZPJKw_eKhZNk2vXAMA9MMTFSjDcljC6SzTiJek_r2pxw) or [dinosaurs](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0838/3573/products/410361w_large.png?v=1441092775) or something, but at this point I'll settle for a nice print/design or even just some color....

But when it comes to weekends I am awful. I feel like I am paralyzed by choice and end up sitting on my ass all day if no one invites me out. I do the same things I do on weekdays, which means I end up reading for most of a day. This isn't a big deal if it is only every once in a while, but it happens to me far too often. It really hit me this past weekend, I didn't take advantage of the 3 day weekend at all because all of my friends were busy or on vacation.

The main problem is that I don't really have hobbies that are ""weekend"" hobbies, all of my hobbies can be performed in 1-2 hour chunks after work.

(Re-posted because I forgot a question mark in the title)

__________________________________________________________________________

* I feel oddly motivated to apologise for the (probably pretty bad) sex, which I know is absolutely not a good move to make unless some pretty serious injuries were experienced (which they weren't! Fuck yeah!) so instead of doing that, how can I fish for some constructive criticism from her without making it weird? Should I even?

* From my time on reddit, I've come to terms with the fact that the first time you have sex it is almost impossible for it to ""WOW!"" your partner unless they too are also a virgin. There may be some cases where this isn't true, but for me it totally was. So I'm not being too hard on myself for the lack of ""WOW!"" because her comment afterwards was ""not bad"" which was then followed by us smiling at each other. So, that's what I really wanted to hear/see. If she was telling the truth, and it was indeed ""not bad"", then awesome! That's a pretty decently okay place to be for the first time, I'd think. Right? Maybe?

* Missionary was absolutely the easier of the handful of positions we attempted. Doggy style wasn't something I went into this wanting to try, but she wanted it so I was down!! And it was an embarrassing failure for a couple of reasons.. 1) No glasses for the duration of sex. She really didn't want me having my glasses on, which I thought was odd at first, but then had an epiphany midway through a poorly coordinated thrust and considered the fact that she had mentioned she's incredibly shy when she's with a guy (I'm the third-ish guy she's slept with, but the first guy in a long time. She's been with two-ish women in the past, and says she's much less shy sexually with a female. Feels more sub with men, dom with women, etc. Even told me to treat her like she's a virgin because she's probably going to seem like one.) atleast four times in the past two days.. 2) Absolute failure at sliding easily in that way, even with her help she only managed to get a bit past the head inside. From there, the thrusts were more like me moving my hips back and forth with my cock not exactly making much motion into her or out of her. Gave up about a minute or so into it (we took a minute and laid down, but got right back to it after I began thinking that having a break like this might end the sex) and helped her back into the much more successful missionary. I did learn something from doggy style and from fingering her, though! I have no idea where to direct my cock/fingers in order to get deeper. Missionary seemed to naturally guide me after she helped me in.

* PIV feels great, hard to describe it. It's like a suck-y, snug, suction-ish kind of.. feeling.. And no, I checked, I did not have sex with a vacuum cleaner. The blur that was in front of me did not even remotely resemble a suck-y suction vacuum cleaner.

* I swear I wasn't lying to her when I said a few months ago that I'm averaged size. My cock is ~6""+, but the awkwardness and nervousness of the situation made it so that I could only get about half hard. No idea how to combat this, it really sucked, but I had sex so.. It's probably something that fixes itself as I get used to it. Still incredibly worrying, though. I really hope she understands.

* Missionary was tiring, I had no idea making that thrusting motion while intimately against each other (she wouldn't let me lean up, might've been because of shyness or having me right against her got her off) would tire me out as much as it did.

* I lasted as long as I wanted to. Which, honestly, wasn't that long because I felt like she was getting bored/wasn't satisfied enough. The only noises/movements she made were the occasional quick inhales of breath when I thrusted, the slight quivering when I finished, her legs getting in comfortable positions, and her arms wrapping around my back in missionary. Maybe she was bored or getting tired of the bad virgin sex, but it probably had a lot to do with me being nervous/paranoid/wanting to please her/etc. Was worried that I'd have trouble with lasting, but yay.

* Foreplay was great and lasted about an hour and a half, if not, more. I lost track of time after I stopped paying attention to it. PIV lasted about 20-25 minutes, I think, until my conscious told me not to drag this out too long. Not sure if my conscious was in the right or not about that.

* Fingering is the bomb, very comfortable and intimate. Her being as wet as she was really was arousing and helped with pretty much everything regarding things going in and around her vagina. Unfortunately, the room and under the covers was warm, so my hands were damp enough so that things like the back rubs beforehand and other foreplay stuff were hard to do comfortably on my end.

* Everything seemed to go smoothly after the sex, not very awkward at all. We had coffee and watched Bruce Almighty together, I left about an hour after we finished.

* **I guess the thing I'm most worried about is if I was good enough for her to want another go at it sometime. ""Not bad"", while it sure could be a compliment, could also mean something like.. ""Ey, I could tolerate it"" and that maybe she was just being nice instead of being blunt.**

_____________________________________________________________________

I think that's pretty much it for my recap. If I think of anything more I will edit it in. Perhaps I can persuade John Madden to analyze the sex next time so that I don't have to ask a bunch of strangers on the internet to do it and tell me what is or isn't normal.

Manners women should have when dealing with men of different ages/status/social background without coming off flirtatious?,"I have a slight issue. Being a nice person, I come off somewhat flirtatious with men, and I end up getting asked out in weird situations where i don't expect it nor want it. In the process I have lost my manners out of fear of coming off flirtatious.

I usually act like a public figure, seriously. I smile to everyone, greet everyone, offer help if I can. I don't flirt with men not implicitly nor explicitly, I don't check men out, I don't trick men into asking me on a date or whatever. I don't do the stuff you see women doing on TV, NONE of it. When I like someone, I crush, keep it to myself and become totally dysfunctional especially around the person.I don't even share with my crush with anyone I know in real life.

For instance:
-It confuses me how inconsistent people are with their greeting habits. you meet someone new they greet you the first day, then ignore you for the rest of the week, then they start greeting you again. so i stopped greeting people. Then I meet someone who makes sure and greet me every damn day and I turn out to be the idiot who's acting weird because I fear coming off as flirtatious...
 
-My 60+ year old dance instructor, asked me to discuss my religious beliefs over coffee. I said:sure!
what the hell am I supposed to say a 60 year old man!!!

Now I wonder, how do u differentiate between situations where you have to be appropriate and respectful to people when they're not necessarily appropriate? I usually pretend not to see what's going on because I don't think it's a good idea to accuse people of things when they could simply deny it.

When has respect or being nice turned into flirtation? Did people loose the meaning of those concepts?

How do you forgive people that have wronged you when they do not know?,"I have a strong sense of personal justice and am deeply loyal. I find myself confused when others take advantage of me or act funny at the expense of my feelings. I try to be supportive/helpful for people but I am either ignored or they will only come to me when they need something. I want to forgive these people for how they've treated me but I am bothered that they continue to live their lives in ignorance. A horrible temptation I've had was to burn bridges and call people out but I would rather choose a more peaceful approach.

Edit: I am also worried that it is something I am doing and I'm ignorant of it. I'm afraid people view me as annoying or needy when all I want is to be their friend. I try to be conscious of my actions but sometimes an outside source is better.

Edit 2: Wow! I'm encouraged by the responses. Thank you all so much for your assistance. I always strive to improve myself. Right now I'm toying with the idea of sending anonymous letters out to the ones that have wronged me most. Nothing in it will be threatening but I think letting them know they have wronged someone will hopefully give them a wake up call and maybe they will treat others with more respect. I will also apologize in the letter for holding a grudge for so long and for anything I've ever done to hurt them.

Edit 3: Thank you all again for your input. Some comments have been hard to read and have made me reflect hard on myself. In some ways I keep lying to myself about my good intentions but I believe I also want to see them hurt like I did and that is not healthy.

What session(s) would you want at a university Men's Summit?,"Every year my university holds a Men's Summit, this is what it's about as taken from the website:

""The event is designed to give male student leaders the chance to discuss and explore the meanings of masculinity in our society. Rather than taking societal masculinity for granted, the Summit aims to shed a new light on American manhood in order to help our attendees begin to define their masculinity on their own terms, rather than allowing the fact they are a man dictate their attitudes and behaviors.
Each year, the Summit features a prominent male key-note speaker as well as a variety of workshops on topics that affect men. Past topics of discussion have included male body image, sexuality, homophobia, men and violence, sex and alcohol, gender stereotypes, and many more. Some of the main goals of the summit are

* to empower men to look at masculinity in our society more objectively
* to give young men at [university] a forum for voicing their thoughts on the issues that affect them
* to allow men to learn from each other to better develop and improve their college experience
* to determine a priority list of men‚Äôs health needs and concerns on campus""

This year, as a graduate student, I have the opportunity to host/cohost a session.

Eventually SHE asked for my Facebook and then a few days later SHE asked me if I wanted to meet up. SHE even picked the day, which was supposed to be today (Monday).

I texted her on on Sunday evening, telling her what time I would be picking her up and what we'd be doing. Monday morning roles along and nothing yet. I simply sent, ""?"" to her.

She finally responds saying that she just got the text, and that she'd have to cancel because her boss called her into work. I'm busy Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, and she's working on Thursday. So, I ask how about Saturday. ""Can't, I have a baseball tourney"" she replied. 

Feeling a little frustrated at this point, I ask her, ""So never? Lol."" She said that we should get together next week, depending on her schedule.

My concern is that she's making excuses and will probably flake out for a second time. I don't know if I necessarily believe that she didn't get my text originally - no indication that she didn't on my end, and usually responds within an hour from my texts - has to work tonight, and has a baseball tourney. It's just unusual behavior because she seemed really into me.

I just might be overthinking this, but I don't know. Would you continue to pursue, or move on? ",AskMen,1440445073,Lanezy,30,0,True,2015-08-24
How can I deal with my girlfriend's dad?,"I've been with my girlfriend for about 4 months, and from time to time her dad will try to get her to do the wrong thing. Latest example, I was out of town last night, she went home and her dad kept pressuring her into drinking (she's on medication that limits her drinking). She kept refusing and he brought it up again. He has also be advertising her to one of his coworkers, a guy who already has a girlfriend, has a lot of similarities to me, and still wants to meet her. I've met her dad several times, he's always very nice and cool with me.

A couple months ago I was away for a few weeks, our relationship was only a few weeks old, and he was basically telling her that she should cheat on me. He's been doing shit like this her whole life, and it's only within the past few years she's seen that he almost always tries to get her to do the wrong thing.

So aside from him trying to sabotage the woman I love, I also feel like it's an insult to me personally, like it's his way of saying I'm not good enough to keep her. We're getting a new place in a few months, and she isn't planning in keeping in touch with him very much if at all.

So my questions are: How should I deal with this? How can I stop myself from beating his face in? How did you deal with it?

TL;DR My girlfriend's dad is always telling her to do the wrong thing, to include cheating on me. I'm not worried about her, but how should I deal with him? Stories and advice please.

Have you ever dated a girl that scared you?,"So I went on a date with a girl tonight, and she really scared me.  I found her online and we met tonight.  I knew well in advance that she was a female bodybuilder.  But when we met, she was MASSIVE.  Her arms were pretty much the size of my head and she told me that she is extremely strong and could lift weight that I couldn't even dream of ever lifting myself.  Some of her numbers were just terrifyingly high.  To explore her strength, I challenged her to armwrestling, and I could NOT budge her arm an inch!  She laughed and slowly and easily pinned my arm down.  And after that, she didn't let go!  I tried desperately to pull my arm away but she kept me pinned to the table so tightly that she was crushing my hand.  I was begging her to let me go until she did.  I clutched my hand and she just sat there and giggled and said that no man has ever beaten her at armwrestling.  I can't imagine what would happen if we were bf/gf and she got mad at me.

I know it's going to be quick (and embarrassing) so I almost always do a great amount of foreplay so I know she gets hers. 

But now I have a girlfriend, and while she makes no mention of my quick trigger and I know she enjoys my generous foreplay, I can't help but feel a little worried that its killing our sexual relationship. The worst is when she's getting there during PIV and I pop off maybe a minute/minute half after insertion. If I try to slow down, she grabs me to speed up. For example, tonight I was quick again...and when I got off, she continued to finish herself off...which kinda made me feel pretty bad.

"Guys, am I the only one who is uncomfortable with telling people to be comfortable?","To elaborate: in a conversation in any context, when someone is discussing a course of action, a resolution, or really doing anything, more often than not, the sentiment of 'do what makes you comfortable/don't do anything that you're not comfortable with' is mentioned.

Am I the only one who doesn't like this advice in most contexts? Surely, it's not to say it's objectively bad advice; there's a lot to say for following your gut/instincts, or not doing something that's pretty obviously a bad idea, but a lot of the time I see the line of advice 'do what's comfortable/don't do what's uncomfortable' as a lazy piece of nonadvice that basically advocates staying inside your comfort zone forever, which as most people would figure, is not the place for radical change or improvement.

Obviously the crux of this sentiment is the assumption that someone *asked you* for advice on a course of action, so with that being said, do you think the advice of 'do what's comfortable/don't do what's uncomfortable' is a cop out? When is it applicable to tell someone, or even yourself, to do something bold, even if will feel shitty/suck for the person doing so? Is that ever inappropriate?

Is there always sexual tension in a group of friends?,"Hi,

I've recently moved to a new city for my job (in the UK) and I've become part of a group of colleagues that are also friends. I have been to a couple of nights out and a barbecue together, and it's just been really nice. 

However, my boyfriend claims that in a group of friends, there is always sexual tension. The guys will always try to come on to the girls in the group. I don't believe that is true. He says it might not seem that way, but he has heard what the guys say when the girls aren't there, and the guys are always trying anyway. Is this really true? 

This issue is really tearing us apart, because I really value my social life and I'm not very flirty or anything, I just like chatting and catching up with friends! I do miss signals sometimes, which is why I don't know whether I should believe him or not. Also, my bf grew up in the UK and I didn't, so he claims I just grew up in a more 'reserved' environment.

When did you last really talk with your dad?,"Background info: I have for some time been, well let's say ""less than fond"" of my dad. He's always been very critical of me and has always had an opinion he's all too willing to share, whether you want to hear it or not, on how you live your life / raise your kids / do your job... The list goes on.  
Well my parents are currently helping me into a new home, by buying the house my wife and I want to live in, and we will rent it until we are able to afford to buy it - at the price my parents paid for it, regardless of the increasing value over time.  
My dad heard me talking on a local talk radio show about the help my In-laws give us in raising our kids day-to-day, and lost it. He thought that I clearly didn't appreciate their help with the house as I didnt mention them in the conversation. He called me and told me he and my mother were very upset and I should think about what I had done, and call them when I was ready to aplologize.
  
Now I have been holding back a lot from my father over the years, and his view of that conversation I had was ""the straw that broke the camel's back"".  
I went to their house today and explained how his interpretation of it was different to my own. I did not wish to insult them, I spoke purely of the people who help with the day-to-day raising of our children, which they have had very little to do with.  
I thanked them personally for their help with the house, and how grateful we are to have this help.  
I decided it was time for this all to be aired, I couldn't keep it inside any longer.  
I told him while I appreciate their help, I didn't realize they were helping us purely for the glory of telling the world how amazing they are for doing so.  
I told my dad of my disappointment that every time he ever said something nice to me, it was always followed by criticism, that his opinions were often derogatory and hurtful and that he always made me feel that I was a disappointment to him.  
For the first time, I told my father how I had suffered through a 3 year long depression in silence, and how I had reached the point of contemplating suicide on multiple occasions, and throughout that time had wished for someone to - just one time - say something nice to me and not criticise me immediately after.  
I told my dad how through the depression I looked to him time and time again for help, and though I was too ashamed to ask for it, I was screaming out in my mind - help me!  
I told my dad I loved him, and my mother, but at times I wondered why, as it never seemed like they felt the same.  
I told him that for a long time, I have struggled to ""like"" him, or feel I should have any kind of relationship with him, and that I wished I had a father who showed literally ANY sign that he really cared for me.  
I told my dad I wanted my parents to be not only more a part of my life, but also my childrens lives.  
I asked my dad to be the father I have always needed, not the father he had become.  
We hugged, he told me he loved me and for the first time ever, I really felt loved and accepted by my dad.  
As tears welled up in his eyes, he promised to be the father I needed in my life, and I cried as we hugged. I thanked him for really listening to me and letting me talk even though what I said must have hurt him at least a little.  

Today, for the first time in my life, I really spoke to my dad.  

I am writing this with the hope my story may inspire you to do the same, because you will only ever have one dad, and the time you have with him is running out faster than you may realize.

"Guys, I think I need to confront and possibly fight a guy. How do I go about this?","First off, I've only ever been in two fights and both have been defensive. I doubt I'm a particularly good fighter, I'm 5'7 and 155 pounds and 23 years old, but I'm pretty strong compared to the other guy at 5,11 and basically all bone. 

Situation: I play sports every weekend with my friends. For three years now and it's been great. However this past year relations have kind of soured with this guy that isn't as close to the rest of us. He tackles way too hard, risking actually injuring people. But he sort of has to come because he's one of the original players this past 3 years and drives another 2 guys in. I'm pretty sure most of the guys are on my side. This past few weeks he's been deliberately trying to agitate me. Last week he went to a whole other level and I snapped. Long story short we sized up, he kept trying to make light of it in the mocking way but there was no fight. I think it would of been wrong of me to hit him then without him throwing the first punch.

Thing is,  I know this guy next week is now mad. Either he's gonna try to hurt me in a tackle badly, in which case I'll straight up go at him if he doesn't succeed,  or I'll come back the next week and hit him straight away. But I'd really rather not have every weekend ruined with stress, potentially injury myself and altogether ruin it for me. I don't wanna get the other guys involved so I need to sort this out myself. So in order to not be further mocked I wanna show him I'm not to be fucked with. Am I best just waiting for him to start his shit then going for the whole push him till it kicks off thing? Or should I warn him at the start of thr game if he does that shit it's happening?

I hope this doesn't come across as douchey.

New-grad with a temporary license. Offered a great job by a company - that spot has filled and they're now offering me something else. Am I stupid to decline?,"I'm a new-grad nurse. I write for my full license mid September, but have a temporary license to practice now. The company I completed my consolidation (450 free hours of work) at offered me a job as a community nurse. Great job, only work 4 days a week, great money, and I loved what I did. The hiring manager told me to talk to her when she's back from vacation in a week.


Fast forward a week and she says she no longer needs me for that job - the person I was going to fill in for decided not to leave. She then offered me a job as a shift nurse - I'll be working palliative and pediatrics (the two areas I dislike the most). The hours will suck (nights), the shifts will be boring, and I likely won't get to practice my skillsets. I'll essentially be supervising overnight (sitting around doing nothing, administering an injection every 2 hours). The pay will be less too - not sure what it will be yet but I'm calling in to ask logistics tomorrow. My interview is Thursday, however the manager said it's just a formality and the job is mine if I want it.



I'm torn on what to do. I don't like the job... but it's a job (that pays much more than minimum wage). It may eventually lead into community nursing, which I already know I love. On the other hand, I have a few connections at a long-term care facility. Boring work, but I'll be making considerably more money.

I [20 M] think my girlfriend [20 F] of 16 months is extremely insecure and I don't know how to deal with it? (X-post from r/relationships),"Hey guys I know this isn't /r/relationships but I would really appreciate a mans opinion on this: 

Okay so I'v been with my SO for over a year now and for the most part things are great, except for one thing. She is insecure.


A lot of the time she doesn't think I love her, doesn't think I think she is pretty, or doesn't think I care for her. I really do love her, care for her and I think she's beautiful.


I know this doesn't sound that bad but every time we hang out or spend time together she will say something like ""you don't love me"", ""you think I'm ___"", ""you don't care"", etc..


A lot of the time I try tell her of course I care, I don't think she's ___, and I do love her but it can be frustrating after months and hurtful when you have invested so much time and emotion into a girl and for her to think you are a loveless robot.


A lot of our fights seam to spiral from her insecurities to. She might pick up something I said wrong or I might get annoyed at the accusations she's making


To give an example I'l give you what's going on now:

So she's an actor and has rehearsals on every day from 11 - 5PM during weekdays. We were organizing what days to hang out and I suggested since she doesn't have rehearsals Tuesday and Wednesday this week that we should hang out from Tuesday to Friday. I thought that she would like the two full days together and the two days she is at rehearsals I could bring her to them and collect her from them and go for coffee each evening.


Turns out that she thought I picked to hang out during the weekdays instead of the weekend because ""I would get to spend less time with her"". It genuinely wasn't I just liked the idea of picking my girlfriend up from rehearsals


Lately whenever she accuses me of not caring or something along those lines I just stop talking to her, which I know is bad since it could reinforce the idea that I don't care but I don't know what to do. Whenever I try explain myself I just get answers like ""sure"" or ""whatever"".


Whenever I check my mail and I see messages like ""nobody cares about me"" or ""I knew you didn't care"" and all I want to do is tell her how much I care but I'v done that in the past and it hasn't worked. Any ideas on what to do?


It's also not a secret that I think she's insecure, I have told her I think she is but she just says ""it's not my fault I don't believe you care""


Besides all of this she is amazing and I can understand why she is insecure (she has had some things happen in the past that would cause problems for anyone).


Another thing I'd like to add that confuses the shit out of me is that sometimes she will randomly say something like ""This isn't working, we both sense it and I think we should end this"". The thing is she could literately be telling me how happy and in love she with me moments before she would say this.


She gets upset if she thinks I'm not taking her seriously about it but I honestly don't know what to say. I usually say ""but you said how happy you were hours ago"" or ""Ah come on ___"" or something along those lines but this can go on for an hour. I do take what she's saying seriously too and I have told her I just want her happy and if she's happier without me that's fine.


So between these accusations and random break ups I am clueless on how to handle the situation? I really love this girl and only want her happy but I don't know what to do.

---

tl;dr: Girlfriend constantly tells me I don't care when I do and sometimes randomly breaks up with me hours before telling me how happy she is with me. I think she's insecure and I just want her happy but I'm clueless on how to handle these situations

Dumped out of the blue?,"Hello, gentlemen:

I need some advice. My boyfriend (37M) of 9 months broke up with me (32F) on Wednesday. He used the old cliche ""It's not you, it's me."" And I guess in this case it kind of is him: I honestly can say I did the best I could to be a kind, supporting, accepting and loving partner over the months we spent together. 

I know he's under a bit of personal and job related stress now, and I genuinely believe the relationship just felt like ""too much"" for him right now. But I'm still floored. We spent a really nice weekend away together over 4th of July and had such a great time. We've been looking forward to a cruise in October. He had a particularly bad day Monday; we spent the evening together and he thanked me for cheering him up and being there for him. We are lunch together Wednesday before, before the dumping, and he was kind and affectionate and like normal. I don't know what happened or what made him decide he needed to end things then, the way he did.

I haven't spoken to him since Wednesday night when he broke up with me, but I'm really hurting. I'm not asking you to help me figure out his behavior and actions, but I am asking for help in figuring out what to do next. Do I continue No Contact and just move on? Do I reach out to him?

"Dad is ""cheating"" on my Mum, I'm the only one that knows. How do I handle this?","Obviously not something I can go around asking my friends about. So I turn to you, /r/AskMen. Your advice is generally pretty solid considering its random people from the internet. Anyway...

Recently my (26M) phone has started playing up - ringing when I receive a call but I can't hear anything when I answer, or not ringing when I receive a call and I can hear the person on the other end. This has meant that I need a new phone, but seeing as my contract runs out in a couple of months I thought I would use my Dad's (54yo) old one as he recently upgraded.

Upon turning the phone on, a Skype call immediately came through. It was a woman who I did not recognise. I let it ring out then disconnected the phone from the home wifi and started to snoop. My Dad has been sexting, sending and receiving adult photos, and video calling a woman on the other side of the world (we're in Australia, woman is in the US). He works in the travel industry and does travel the world quite extensively but I don't think he has ever met this woman in person. I went through his email and Facebook and there was no other communication or connection with this lady. I'm not sure how he met her, but I don't think they have met in person (but I don't have any proof either way).

So my initial reaction to finding this was disappointment. I could not see why he would do this to my Mum (56yo), his wife for over 30 years. They have a generic marriage - arguments and bickering but never getting too bad. I've said and done worse things to my Mum than Dad ever has. I know they love each other, I still live at home so I see it every day. But at the same time I feel like I should tell my Mum what is going on. If I was in my Mum's position I would want to be told immediately. My girlfriend and I recently broke up after I confronted her with rumors of her cheating on me. (I don't think she was, but the relationship ended anyway. We are still friends)

But the more I thought about it, the more I understood his position. My Mum is not one to be adventurous. She came from an Asian country with deep rooted traditions about how girls should act. I seriously doubt that their sex life goes past vanilla flavour, and I don't think Dad has been getting any action from her in more than a decade. I seriously doubt that my Mum would be responsive to Dad's needs. What harm is there in him getting a little bit of excitement in his sex life? As long as it doesn't become physical then is it really something I should bring up with Mum? I thought I should at least talk to Dad about it. But sex is not something we talk about. It was only after I went through a period of deep depression over my girlfriend that we talked about relationships in general.

I'm really stuck as to how I go forward with this. I want to warn off my Dad, because if I let him continue what he's doing there is the chance it could escalate. Also, I don't want my Mum to end up hurt over this. She has worked hard all her life to provide for our family. Our family didn't come from money on either side but she has been the driving force to build us up into the very comfortable position we're now in.

I could certainly understand if you know someone personally, but like the latest crazed nut shooting, I just see it happened on the news and think, ""Oh, another one of those. Yeesh."" Similar to how I think of people suffering in North Korea, or Syria, or the like. I don't think it's good, and I think about how to fix it, but it doesn't really affect me emotionally.

"Fellow Gamers of AskMen: How do you feel about the current status of ""nerd/gaming culture""?","It seems like video game articles these days are filled with discussions about gender inequality and racist forms of shit-talking pervading the culture. Most of this stuff is a hot topic issue in general right now, but I find it gaining traction in the gaming sphere more and more lately.

I've talked to a few fellow nerds and gamers who find it ridiculous that anyone would suggest the entire community is ""noninclusive"" since it was built by people who were picked on before it became acceptable and chic to be a nerd. They feel it is a safe haven they built for people who were, by definition, never included and most would never wish that on anyone else. Others say, since they built it for themselves, its insulting for new people to come in who don't get it and demand it change.

What fatherly advice would you give to a girl with an emotionally absent father?,"I got the idea of posting after reading a similar post that was posted a few days ago in regards to boys without fathers. 

A little context: 
I'm in my early 20s, I graduated from college last year and started my job in the career field I worked hard for. Growing up I was ""daddy's girl"" always making him proud with my good grades, good attendance, taking care of my younger siblings (I'm the eldest) ... Etc. I come from a very traditional, catholic, conservative family (though I don't consider myself religious). from the age of 16-19 I had the same boyfriend who my parents did not approve of because he didn't work/didn't want to go to school. I broke things off with him before finishing school because I realized on my own that i didn't want to end up with someone like him for the rest of my life. Anyways, when I upset or ""disappoint"" my dad he doesn't yell at me. He completely ignores me and gives me the silence treatment for weeks/months! My best friend got her own apartment about a year ago and so I was spending a lot of time over there. After I'd come back my dad would harass me about going over to my friends house. He said I was lying and actually going to see my ex and that I'm weak for not being able to move on. I of course became defensive and CLEARLY told him I ended things with him years ago and explained the situation. He gets Into these irrational childish trances that make me break down because of how ridiculous and untrue they are. I started smoking weed to help me cope and to get me to eat but that kind of made things worse because they found my bong piece and now I'm ""a disappointment and going down the wrong path"" in his words. He hasn't spoken to me since. I feel like I have no father. I resent him more and more every day. I have no relationship with him, and I'm angry just typing this. I'm experiencing new life changes with my job and I moved out (because of all the drama at home) I'm doing this completely on my own which feels amazing but I'm terrified and want healthy advice. 

I also haven't been attracted to any man (or woman for that matter) since I grew to hate my dad. I get asked out but I feel this need to put walls up and reject.

How do I START a relationship life at 28?,"I'll try to keep things concise and pre-amble free.

I turned 28 last month, and I've never been in a relationship.  I'll explicitly state a few points that some people have been incredulous to over the years.
* Yes, I am a virgin.
* No, I have never had a girlfriend.
* No, I have never kissed.
* No, I am not joking.
* Yes, I am serious.
* Yes, really, I **am** serious.
It's not shyness.  I was shy in middle school, but I long since overcame that shit.  And I don't have a problem talking to people; its more that I just don't like going out.  And since I don't go out, I've never been stellar with conversation.  But that's just one aspect of the bigger problem: ""Let's say I want to start dating, I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing.""  Whereas most anyone I'd be engaging in this with has probably been at it for at least a decade.

I don't want to unpack too much boring shit, and anyone I've told this to usually has lots of questions, so hopefully I'll try to field questions and maybe take some advice?  I dunno.

They said it was a ""joke"" because women are defenseless against men and they live with the paranoia of walking home everynight that it could happen to them, so a man will never understand the fear women go through.

We kind of just switched topics because we were almost going at each others throats at that point. I'm not a men's right activist or anything but just hearing that rape is more biased towards one side and the other is a ""joke"" just didn't sit right.

Smiling to strangers and premature ejaculation -- how do these work?,"A couple of questions about smiling to strangers and premature ejaculation... not at the same time, fortunately.

1) Flirting is supposed to start with eye contact and a smile. Women smile at me on occasion on the street or at the office or whatever, that fleeting smile after making eye contact. The problem is I'm incapable of smiling back. I have asshole resting face.

I want to practice in the mirror, but what smile should it be? ""I'm friendly"" smile? ""I'm so happy to see you"" smile? ""My thoughts right now are NSFW"" smile? Teeth? No teeth? Help, I don't want to have a creepy smile!

2) I've had premature ejaculation since I've started having sex at 18. At 35 I finally want to fix it. I've been doing kegels and Cock Hero with a silicone sleeve and I can now go for 15-20 minutes.

During the first 5 minutes or so I get close to a point where I have to stop for a few seconds, breathe, and ""hold it in"". If I cum at this point it's a pleasurable but weak orgasm. If I manage to continue for a while and cum when I want to, I get an amazing, moaning, full-body-shaking orgasm.

So for people without PE, is this how it works for you? Will the kegels help me hold it in without stopping when I get to that first point of no return? In other words, how does sex work when you don't have PE?

How do you guys deal with overwhelming tasks at hand?,"I realize that the title is kind of vague, but here's the situation.
I'm 22 years old, and am now taking a summer math course that will hopefully make me an engineering student come September.
The math course itself spans 6 weeks, and is intense as all hell. Six hours a day are spent in school, with a decent amount of homework each day, and a weekly homework assignment.
Becoming an engineer has been my dream since I was 13, with math and physics being my favorite subjects in school. But man, I'm having such a hard time with this, that it's making me reconsider my decision. In class, I do reasonably well. But this math course is progressing so fast, that I have a hard time wrapping my head around some of the things we learn. Whenever I get home after school, I just feel exhausted mentally and usually can't think about math for the rest of the day.

The weekly assignment is due wednesday, and I told myself I'd work on it tomorrow. But the thing is, I'm afraid of getting started, cause I'm afraid of not understanding the problems presented in said assignment, and moreso I'm afraid of failing the math course.

Besides that I have other hobbies and commitments. I play guitar, but have hardly practiced it for the past 3 weeks, since the math course began, and whenever my girlfriend is home we usually just cuddle and watch movies, with me not having the energy to do much else.

I realize that the answer to this question is simply "" Man the fuck up, Dropsonic! "". But I'm wondering, has anyone else been in a similar situation, where they just felt overwhelmed? Share your stories with me r/askmen , and give me some perspective on this.

Why is it generally harder for men to open up about their emotions?,"I said GENERALLY. I know that a lot of guys have no issue with opening up about their emotions and I know its SOCIETY that shapes this belief, but a lot of guys I know have more difficulty opening up about their emotions than the women I know (when I say women opening up I don't just mean about their negative emotions but positives as well).

My main question is, what goes through a guys mind when they are having trouble opening up about how they feel? What types of things hold them back, etc? ",AskMen,1437864133,Constellations3,60,16,True,2015-07-25

What are your guidelines for when/where it's appropriate to touch women under various circumstances?,"I'm 23 and I've never touched a woman except hugs, handshakes, and kisses. I don't know how to flirt beyond just making jokes and playful banter. I.e., I have no idea how to escalate to anything beyond getting them to like me. But I need to learn, and the first step is to know what's expected/wanted.

The thought of breaking the touch barrier freaks me out. The last thing I ever want to do to someone is make them feel uncomfortable or do something that is unwanted. I don't feel like stepping over the line and learning from it is acceptable.

A few questions would really help clear things up:

1) Last night, a hot girl I'm friends with, as usual, was flirty toward me. She has no trouble breaking the touch barrier when flirting. For example, I was sitting in a chair, and she walked by and stroked my chin seductively. I've never flirted with her, I've always just let it happen. She has a boyfriend, so I'm obviously not going to do anything to escalate. But pretend for a second that she didn't have a boyfriend. What would be acceptable to do to her if she's stroking my chin and making sex jokes? Where's the line?

2) For me, I could break the touch barrier much easier when kissing, though I have not attempted it. I feel like touch before that is presumptuous. Is that normal? Do you break the touch barrier before kissing, normally?

3) What are some good ways to work up from standing a couple feet from a girl at a party, to touching? What kind of touching should I work up to in that setting?",AskMen,1437872157,[deleted],13,2,True,2015-07-25
I'm never sexually attracted to the people I'm emotionally attracted to and vice versa. How common is this and how can I overcome it?,"I keep a running list of ideas. Things I might want to write about or sing about or just think about later. I was going through this list and as a big if hypnotic habit tried to click it as if it were a post on Reddit.

So as the title says, I have a hard time connecting these two things sometimes. I'm wondering how common it is, what you have to say about it, and if you've overcome the same: how you approached it?

A bit about me, I was to be a pretty overweight guy growing up and because of that I was never really interested in pursuing women but always had crushes. Big crushes. After losing quite a bit of weight and gaining quite a bit of confidence I started dating but this wasn't until I was in my later twenties; I'm thirty now. 

Once I started dating, I found it easy to engage with women and that vulnerability really allowed me  to enjoy the new found freedom of talking to new people...but developed this sort of habit of finding myself in situations where the person I was seeing would be like me and want to pursue something more serious (a lot of times too soon(or maybe it's not and I just thought so)) and on the other hand, women that were less interested would be more desirable. It's like when I'm pursued I develop sexual attraction, when I'm passed up I develop an emotional attachment. It's a situation where I can see the pattern but can't see how to change it. Can you relate?

TLDR; I'm never sexually attracted to the people I'm emotionally attracted to and vice versa, what should I do? How is my behavior or thought process causing this?",AskMen,1437872247,omnes,10,14,True,2015-07-25

Do you think some women are 'too good to be true'?,"I'm a 25 male and always been the average guy- Not ugly but not hot, not a great job, not a lot of money, not an extraordinary life, I'm a bit geeky , shy... I'm not particularly unconfident, but let's just say I'm average.
Now I've been with my SO for 1 year. I don't want to put her on a pedestal, she has her faults, but sometimes I've got that feeling she's too good to exist. She has that social vibe everyone would love to- she basically can understand anyone and it's hard not to enjoy her presence. At the same time she's always been a very nice and keen person- tolerant with everyone. She's a bit geeky like me and enjoys everything- video games, movies , my geeky friends. Did I mention she was the magazine model type hot? Maybe a bit too skinny but very fit, great face, great smile. And yes, she has a kick ass job, she's intelligent and motivated- enrolled next year in a top-10 MBA.
She's not perfect- no such thing exist. She has for example a bad temper sometimes. Now I still get that feeling that she's too good to be true .
I'm not asking to put her down, but just wondering if you can understand my feeling? I'm always scared to discover that maybe deep down- for someone that hot /smart/ to be that nice/tolerant - there must be something that destroyed her in the past or something?
Maybe she will just not stay with me? Did you ever had the feeling ? Did you meet some people that really were like that?

Would you judge your wife for being too sexy in the bedroom?,"I always feel that If I truly reveal how naughty I am, a guy would think I am not wife material. This happened in the past with a guy I briefly dated. He called me ""unhinged"". From then on, my brain sort of separates the ""porn star"" from the ""wife"". I feel that If I am very naughty in the bedroom, the guy will lose respect for me outside the bedroom. To clarify, I want just one man but I want that one man (whoever it may be) very badly. I am not talking about flirting with many men or exposing oneself in public. More like  a modest woman that goes crazy with the man she loves. I know the whole ""crazy"" stereotype where guys say that women who are porn stars in the bedroom are crazy and not gf material.

Do you differentiate women? Is your gf/wife very naughty in the bed?

Yet I have never dated anyone before, but have been very observant in my short life and believe if I'm going to start anywhere, it's going to be this girl.

I'm quite confident in myself so it really is no problem, so I have ideas on how to officially start something. I have to admit, I'm a little nervous that if i get rejected later on, it will be kind of awkward, but I'm willing to take the risk. 

She really is the star of many of my friends but i feel like i have a shot. Its almost like whenever we hang out in groups, or just talk on breaks or after work, that she's waiting for me to ask her to do something.

Girlfriend got a text message - she asked me to check her phone later and I noticed it was gone. She denies ever getting it. Suspicious?,"Girlfriend and I have been dating a year. Relationship is great - never fight, she stays over 6 nights out of the week, given me no reason not to trust her (if a guy texts her / messages her she tells me), etc. When she was 18 and in college she cheated on her boyfriend of about a year - she says he was abusive, however completely regrets it and feels terrible. She told me this before we started dating. We're both 21 now. This morning her phone vibrated as if she got a text, I looked over because I thought it was my phone and she was looking down at her phone typing. I thought nothing of it. Later on her mom messages her and she asks me to read the text to her so I do. I noticed that there were no other text messages from today, leading me to believe maybe she deleted the text she got. I asked her and she casually replied ""I didn't get a text today?""


Again, she's given me no reason not to trust her. There's a guy at her new work that she became friends with. He started to get weird and would message her stuff like ""you looked great leaving work in your summer dress today!"", etc. He has a girlfriend, but she shows me immediately.

She's staying at my apartment back there, since she didn't have a place to live for the summer and I'm renting an apartment near the place I work.

I've gone back every weekend since the summer started, and usually once during the week as well just for a night, and honestly I really want to take a weekend to just drink beer and play video games with my friends. She's working a ton this weekend, so if I go back I'm gonna spend most of the day waiting for her to get off work, and the rest bored because neither of us have spare money to do anything right now. I feel shitty because it's not even like I don't want to see her... I just don't want to be bored all weekend.

Of course, if I put it like that she'll get offended, probably for somewhat good reason, and sad that I'm not coming back. She probably wouldn't say anything to my face about it, but I know that's how she'd react... fuck, idk. I feel like not wanting to spend a weekend together and feeling the need to come up with some bullshit as to why I wouldn't go back this week is a sign that my relationship is probably going to be over soon, which is really shitty.

"My girlfriend believes being gay is wrong because it's a ""choice""... How can I explain this to her!?","I'll keep this short, on mobile for now, but I was just talking to my girlfriend while she's at her church camp deal and she dropped a bomb on me. We're both mid twenties. I am crazy about this girl, she's perfect for me and we complement each other very well. She is smart and progressive in a lot of respects. I'm bringing this question to askmen because I've read a lot of the posts here and it's some good content. Lots of good discussions and advice. 

Now I had a sneaking suspicion she had this view, her parents are very conservative and her brother has posted some similar beliefs onto his Facebook, but I didn't think she'd so casually say it and just move on. We were talking about work (old folks home) and how some residents would hate the shit out of some of our employees if they knew they were gay. And all of a sudden she says it... And my heart just drops. ""I don't believe being gay is right, it's not a good decision to make. I don't agree with that lifestyle."" And just moves on. Like... What the fuck? 

I'm stunned. Didn't say anything, tried to compose myself and have a calm discussion. I explained how people are attracted to what they're attracted to. They can't change that. I can't wake up one day and have a foot fetish and seriously, honestly be fulfilled and truthfully be attracted to it. Same with men... I can't just one day decide that a relationship with a man will be as sexually and romantically fulfilling as a relationship to a woman for myself. 

I've made serious progress in the short talk we had, she does agree that some people are genuinely attracted to the same sex and won't be able to have a fulfilling relationship with the opposite sex. It seems her main reason for having this view is some of her girl friends have ""tried"" women after shitty relationships with men. Same with the gay guys at our work, they said they've ""tried"" women and it just didn't work for them. So her view is that there are people out there who are able to choose what sex they want to date. 

In a weird way we agree... People who treat being gay like a fad and ""try it out"" for a few months are kinda shitty people. They lead on actual gay men and women and end up hurting them when they don't feel the same. I've had a couple friends do this and they really fucked over some people. It's a really dishonest thing to do. Some people do legitimately need to experiment and see what works for them, but I'm not talking about them. As long as they're honest with their feelings more power to them. Date anyone you want! 

But it's still not quite where I want it to be. As in... Being gay isn't a fucking choice for anyone. Attraction isn't a choice. 

What other ways can I explain this to her and not have it be in an attacking or aggressive manner? All thoughts welcome, especially from those brought up to believe these things. How can I change her view on this!?",AskMen,1436551354,Matthieu101,63,7,True,2015-07-10

How many of you celebrate your anniversary with your SO the day of?,"Hello gentlemen (and ladies)! 

I'm curious as to how many of you celebrate your anniversary the day of, or do it on a nearby date. 

I ask this because I'm in quite a predicament: my 1 year anniversary is this Monday. It's great and I'm excited! She's a fun, loving, and compassionate woman. However, my sister is getting married in 2 weeks, for which I'm a groomsman in, and her fianc√©es bachelor party is also on Monday.. 

This isn't a bachelors party with strippers and all that. My father, brother, brother in law, and soon to be brother in law, got a room in a casino and will be staying there. As a groomsman, I feel it's my obligation to go. And I'm absolutely stuck. If I go, my GF will be forever mad at me. If I don't go, my family will be upset with me. Once the groom announced to his friend he'll be getting married, they all bailed. That leaves 4 people, including the groom, at his party. 

I talked to my GF about this and she told me to go. Now this wasn't your typical 'yeah babe you should go have fun! A bachelors party is only once! We can do dinner another day!' Type of go. This was a 'go and you'll regret it' type of go. It's a lose lose situation for me and I was looking for some advice! 

Thank you all for the help!

"[x-post] Do you think it's wrong for a man to ask for a paternity test for a child, and why?","My question stems from a post in /r/relationships[1] [1] where a wife is asked for a paternity test because the child looks significantly different from the father.
The most upvoted of the posts call for shaming the father or a dissolution of the marriage, whereas most of the posts asking for empathy or understanding of the husbands perspective are downvoted.
My personal opinion is this: Most people (including women) have cheated, currently cheat or would cheat given the opportunity. People want their partners to trust them, but trust is not a shield or preventative measure against cheating.
Furthermore, most cheaters deny cheating, even up to being caught red handed, so asking for honesty is in practical terms unrealistic (i.e. most people will say they havent cheated because they havent, or they dont want to get caught.)
Men also face being court ordered to pay child support for children proven not to be theirs, even to the extremes of having gag orders placed on them.
I have not touched on the negative social ramifications of raising a child that's not theirs, like being labelled a cuckold, but they exist.
So considering all of the liabilities a man could face for not knowing his childs lineage, do you think it would be wrong for him to ask for a paternity test?

- Hydration. I normally always drink a lot, so I don't think this would be the issue. I hardly ever drink sodas, I mainly drink tap water, coffee and tea.

- Hydration on the area by using either slices of Cucumber or used Tea bags.

- Massage techniques.

- Proper exercise, I do cardio three times every week and I lift three times as well. 

- Limited computer/tv usage, I try not to use these for more than one/two hours per day

"How do you give a friend a ""tough-love"" talk on his relationship woes?","This friend of mine - a pretty good-looking, smart and fit guy - is perpetually single. Recently though, the reasons for his single-ness have become way more obvious to me. Example: He met a woman through Tinder I think he was genuinely into, and by his accounts she seemed nice too. He texted me a few times asking if it's normal for someone not to text back within certain time periods after getting a text. Then he showed me his exchanges with her and it basically reads like him being pretty needy, pointing out her lack of prompt replies in the texts, and eventually this all led to the girl saying she just had too much on her mind to get involved further (she was very nice about it but I suspect he scared her off). To add to this, he told me about his second date with her, which involved them going to a higher-end restaurant that she picked, and him complaining during the whole dinner that he could've done a better job cooking for her than the restaurant, for way less money (He's a major penny-pincher since he's not making much money right now). She even offered to pay half the bill and he said no, because he's kind of a prideful guy to boot. I really wanted to tell him, ""Wow, dude you insulted the place she picked the whole time???""

* It was pretty good.

* My penis was dripping slightly with a watery liquid that didn't look like cum when I went to the toilet. Urinating wasn't painful nor did it burn. 

* All day there has been a slight pain in my... abdomen right? Anyway, the right side of it is sore. Very very light pain/discomfort. (Update, it vanished. Didn't soothe, but literally vanished in a second. Maybe it was the water I drank earlier)

* I'm 18 and sexually inactive. 

* I don't masturbate (Not from 'No-fap' I just never did it growing up. No reason as to why. Wet dreams are frequent as a result)

I'm 5'8 and weigh 186. I'm chubby. Today I worn a green tshirt and went to my class. It wasn't that hot, just nice and warm. My back felt super wet. I was wearing a backpack so maybe that had something to do with it.

I went to the bathroom and looked at my back, it was wet. It was just super embarrassing. I felt so ashamed and pathetic. I'm not even that fat, but for my t-shirt to become dark with sweat? Maybe I just sweat too much, I don't know. Does that happen to you?

She has also directly told me that there are rumors circulating about how my boss ""likes me too much, something's going on"" which made things uncomfortable as none of that garbage is true. We just think alike, work well together and our interactions are appropriate.

Now she has managed to share credit for things that I've done alone (so as not to be ""left out""), among other things, and the relationship between my boss and I is awkward at best.

What the hell is going on?,"Hello fellow redditors. 
Today I come to you to ask for some advice about this huge crush I have.

              
So, there's this girl I have really fallen for, to be honest I can't remember the last time I was so in love with someone to the point where I have dreams about her very often (not sexual, most of them don't even make sense but she's there).

  So to give you a little background this is a girl that has been in my college class for 3 years. I always found her pretty cool, had similar tastes in music, movies etc but for some reason I didn't find her attractive.

So about 6 months ago she started to text me and I decided to go along with it, with no intentions at that time, and it was simply awesome. She looked like she was really into me always trying to make up conversation and being flirty and all of that sweet stuff.

At one point when we started to get really close I got a bit scared because I had broken my ex girlfriend heart and I was afraid that I would do the same to her so I didn't really make my move.. I became stationary.

Just as a side note I broke my ex-girlfriend‚Äôs heart because I didn‚Äôt really love her while she was completely obsessed by me. I felt pretty bad about it and I don‚Äôt want to make anyone get through that again.  

To prevent that from happening with this girl I decided to stop talking to her for a little bit to see if my feelings were real  or if it was just because I was feeling lonely (that‚Äôs selfish, I know). 

Those 4 days were extremelly painful and when I couldn't take it anymore I talked to her again but things had already turned south.

From around this point on, maybe a bit before that her interest didn't seem to be the same. 
She was not flirty anymore.. We would still have fun but her hints about wanting me were pretty much gone. 

As things turned worse and worse I decided I should just let go.. stop talking to her definitively and try to move on.. I had no idea it would be so damn hard, I think about her 24/7 and after 3 weeks or so without talking she started to talk to me again but it‚Äôs like she wants me to be constantly making conversation and when I don‚Äôt ask anything she will just read it and leave it‚Ä¶. and it‚Äôs basically driving me insane.

I decided I let her taste her own medicine, I made a question she answered and afterwards I didn‚Äôt reply anything back.. Which is stupid, childish and definitely something that I didn‚Äôt want to do but that‚Äôs the thing.. I don‚Äôt know what to do , or even what to think.

I have thought about asking her out but at this point I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good idea, maybe if she gave me any sort of sign that she wants to be with me but she really does not, all we do is small talk.

I have never confronted her with any of this because I don't think I have the right to judge her nor do I have any power about what she wants.. For all I know she just sees me as a friend and that's that. Is this friendzone? Probably but at the same time, it‚Äôs weird..

After this long rant.. please fire away , feel free to tell me how bad I am with girls.

Has anyone worked with an online company before? Have you worked with one in the past?,"I just did an interview over Google Voice for an online company and it was the first time I've ever done such a thing. They were looking for an internship program but I told them I had a summer research program at ANU - they told me that if it weren't for the time difference, they would've hired me. He said that while their blog didn't need any help, I could contribute for free, and they also had lot of sales posts they need help with that I could volunteer for. They concluded that they couldn't accomodate me for a ""super short time"". 

I don't know how online companies work, but if I don't have to be in an office, I can pretty much work from anywhere with internet, right? I'm emailing them to let them know that I can work for longer than the summer if I don't have to be in an office and hopefully that gets me somewhere.

"Men who've dated women that let themselves go during the relationship; how'd your relationship go, in that regard?","My ex stopped working out and started eating a lot of junk food  when we started dating. At the beginning of the relationship I was very attracted to her. After dating for 16 months she'd gained a lot of weight. Obviously it's her body and she can do whatever she damn well pleases with it, but I no longer found her attractive.  
  
I felt like a shallow asshole, but I never pressured her to change and never said anything. While I was at the gym four days a week and eating blueberries and spinach, she'd laugh about eating an entire box of oreos and two liters of pop during a netflix marathon.  
  
I don't actually care if she wants to live like that, but it's not really compatible with my lifestyle.

"What type of girl did you not want to date, but ended up dating anyway?","I just posted this over at AskWomen and now want to hear from you men.

So I have a couple of friends that were adamant on not dating certain types of guys but somehow ended up dating them anyway. For example:

Friend 1: Didn't want to date an Asian, especially not one that just came from Asia recently, and that was younger than her (not even by a few months!). Now, she is dating a Hong Konger who just came to Canada like 3 years ago and is 2 years younger than her.

Friend 2: Adamant on wanting to date Asians only. Refuse the idea of ever potentially dating a white guy (makes fun of me for being more attracted to white guys). Now, she is dating an all around American guy LOL.

I just found these instances hilarious since they were so sure they would never date a certain type, but ended up dating exactly what they didn't want.

So I'm curious if you guys have done the same. Be it a type of personality, race, age, occupation, political beliefs, whatever.

Time frame on hearing back from potential employer?,"Hey guys. The question is pretty much in the title, but I'm wondering how long it s taken others, or if there is a general time frame that hearing back from an employer takes.

A bit of backstory: I've worked with this group before, and apparently did well there. I was nervous about the interview, prepared like crazy, and actually had a good time talking with everyone. It was nice to speak with old colleagues and new people, and I think I really nailed it.

Anyway, the time question. 
How long for you guys, how long usually?

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks for the responses! Seems like two weeks is a general time-frame. It hasn't been two weeks yet so I'll be seeing, and be sure to follow up not too long after two weeks.

"Gentlemen, could we discuss the recent Mad Max film, and a couple of it's misconceptions in the trailer? [spoilers for Fury Road]","In the last two days I have seen Fury Road and Jurassic World back to back. It's been a good week, but that is beside the point. I had originally asked a friend if he'd like to accompany me to see the film, yet he refused on the grounds that he did not wish to see any sexual assault, which is something that has always upset him. 

Upon seeing the film, it became apparent early on that despite being a despicable warlord who took in young men from the wasteland and raised them to be ruthless killers, fed on harvested breast milk and indoctrinated by a strange cult that took the most violent and glorious parts of multiple cultures, Imorten Joe's reason for pursuing his traitor was not one of a lust for aggression or irrational hatred and mistreatment of women folk, but a sense to preserve his family. The abduction (in his mind, not accepting the willingness of his harem to escape from their confinement) was in of itself not as severe a crime as the abduction of a woman bearing his child. In all of the scenes later into the film, the man shows a disgruntled sort of tenderness for his multiple wifes, and shown to mourn their apparent loss at the start of the final act. The use of the word ""property"" and ""ownership"" to me reflected the loss of expression in the aftermath of the apocalypse, and the absolute control that people had to exert over others in order to fully apply any semblence of protection. A harsh Hobbesian truth overshadowing a paternal love. 

However, the trailer for the film never showed any of that. The trailer may have avoided spoiling everything, but I cannot deny upon rewatching it, that the struggle over the women was thrown into everybody's face, and a lot of people reached preemptive conclusions about what sensitive material the film might have shown. Rape has appeared in the Mad Max films before (including male-on-male, which gets 0.01% the same amount of coverage in culture and media), but it felt twisted to me that the advertisers would focus so heavily on the to-and-fro over the women like a game of capture-the-Victoria's Secret model flag. 

What do you guys think? Personally on visuals and explosions alone, I think Fury Road by far surpasses what the Road Warrior achieved, and the gender issue is just a moot subplot in regards to the fractured factionalism that the scarcity of the destroyed world generates.",AskMen,1435268956,[deleted],11,0,True,2015-06-25
Going out with a girl from work; any tips on how to behave?,"Some backstory here:

I'm 25. Back in March, I (along with another department head) hired a new employee, who split her time between reporting to me and reporting to someone else. 

We get along really great. We always make each other laugh, we have similar sensibilities regarding practically everything, and we frequently have deep/interesting discussions. Any time there's a meeting or a work-related function, we almost always end up talking to each other exclusively.

On Friday, we're going to see the comedian Marc Maron. **She no longer reports to me**, so I'm no longer her boss anymore, but we are still co-workers, and I'm technically higher up on the pecking order. I've paid for her ticket, and there's a good chance we'll get dinner or a drink either before or after.

I really like this girl, and it's a chance to ""make a move,"" so to speak (or at least indicate my interest); however, I am acutely aware of our roles in the workplace, and I absolutely do not want to do anything that would make her feel uncomfortable. I couldn't live with myself.

I may have misread a friendly invitation as a serious one. I think I invited myself to a really bad first date. What do I do?,"Hey everyone,


I just recently broke it off with a girl and I was back in the online dating sphere when I started talking to and exchanged numbers with a girl. We've been talking on and off for about a week trying to match our schedules for a first date. Today she mentioned she was going to see a concert nearby both of us and then she told me I should buy a ticket and come.


I searched for the concert and sure enough there were tickets available. I told her I was picking one up. It all kinda happened really fast.


Now I just found out this is part of a bday celebration for her and that she is going with a bunch of friends. She just asked me if I was going to ask any of my friends to go with me.


Now it's obvious that was more of a ""you should go to the concert"" rather than a ""you should go to the concert with me"" kind of thing. I just texted a buddy to see if he would go but if I can't find anyone to go on such short notice (the concert I tomorrow night) what do I do?


How do I avoid anything awkward? Can I? I mean yeah this will be just the first time I meet this girl but I would rather not screw something up so early.

Should I break up with my high school girlfriend before I go to university?,"I originally thought that the answer to this question was going to be a lot easier to make. But now I have absolutely no clue. So first let me tell you some key information about her and I.

For the past 6 years, ""Lana"" and I have liked each other on and off. Every time we have come close to dating or doing anything serious, she would pull away. I'm not really going to go into the specifics of each time we have liked each other but to paint a bit of a picture of the affect it had on me, her pulling away every time made me extremely cautious when flirting with her.

What I later found out was that Lana was terrified of ruining our friendship and scared that things wouldn't work out, so she would quit before anything happened.

However, cue March of 12th grade. 3 months ago. Lana starts talking to me. Again. After about a few days of talking to her, I can tell that she likes me. Again. But I'm not falling for it this time. So I very lightly respond to her flirting and rarely make a first move to do anything. A couple weeks of her talking to me online and in school, I begin to sense that this time will be different, but I still hold off. After prom (Lana and I didn't go together) Lana and I met up and walked around until the sun rose. It was the most amazing night. We talked about everything between us.

That night Lana talked about her commitment problem, how she was scared of losing our friendship, and how she was scared of what could happen if we had a relationship. At the time, I was still very aloof with her, not trying to fall for her tricks, so I agreed that we shouldn't have a label on whatever this was between us, and just see how things go from there.

In short, Lana and I started ""dating"". Now another piece of key information you need to know about Lana is that she loves hanging out with her friends. That is one thing I love about her, and one thing I hate about her. I hate it because she very rarely puts me before them. I realize that is selfish of me to say, however it would be nice if she wanted to hang out with me as well. Her hanging out with her friends isn't that big of a deal, but it is an integral part of her personality.

Final piece of information about Lana. Her and I are both going to the same university. This is merely coincidence, we did not decide to go to the same university because of each other. Now this university is big, and we will be in two different faculties. Lana brought up a while back the concern that if we kept this going in college, then we may never see each other. She will want to hang out with her new friends and being in two different faculties we will rarely see each other. At the time she brought this up, I had the intention of breaking up with her. However I told her just go with the flow, if you want it to work, we will figure it out. Every time we went out and she got a little bit drunk, she would bring up university and if we should stay together.

Right now I am on the last day of my senior trip, and through these past 8 days I have completely fallen for Lana. I let my wariness of her pulling away fade. Now all I want to do is be with her, talk to her, just see her face. 

Ahh I am rambling now. I hope this is enough information to help you help me. If you have any more questions please just ask.

Have you ever had an eating disorder?,"I really want to hear what you went through. What caused it, did you ever recover, how did you recover and anything else you went through really. Its hard finding people to connect to about this.

My issues came from weight loss.

After losing over 160lbs, I hit my goal weight of 140lbs. I wasn't happy in the end. I developed a really unhealthy body image, it led to me hating my body, becoming paranoid about gaining weight and it really took a toll on me. I hated leaving the house and became really anxious when I had to do so. 

Eventually food became sort of a comfort and I began binge eating really hard then purging. Anytime I became anxious or stressed, I binged then purged, it became an automatic response to any sort of stress. It led to a rapid weight gain and led to my issues becoming even worse. 

Eventually I got help, I got diagnosed with Bulimia recently and currently visit my local eating disorder service a couple times a week for therapy. I know it isn't going to be a quick fix, but I am glad I am on the right path to getting better again instead of binge eating and purging 7 days a week.",AskMen,1433915463,Broken_Pikachu,20,35,True,2015-06-09

Can the bros of Reddit help? Friend fucked up bad and we don't know what to do.,"So I'm typing for my buddy who is a catastrophic mess right now. 

My best friend, we'll call him Reid, is rule 1 and 2 to the extreme. Six pack, model-esque, funny as fuck and doing a PhD. You'd hate him if he wasn't so humble. Anyway the guy absolutely carved it up with the ladies until about 21 when he met the love of his life, we'll call her Anna. We're 29 now and until last week he'd never strayed. 

So for a while they've been set to move overseas and she's gone a month early to visit friends. Two days after she leaves he sleeps with his neighbor. He's filled with regret but more or less safe.... Until he notices a small abrasion on his cock. He thinks back. He wore a condom but remembers she had noticeably chapped lips. So he goes to the doctor freaking out and is now waiting for the test results thinking he's got herpes. 

But here's the rub. 8 years and despite his looks, despite his flirting, despite the endless women hitting on her man, Anna has never been anything but trusting, loving, supportive. Not once has she ever batted an eye at boys nights, strip clubs, porn or even perving and flirting. For the last year she's been goodheartedly ribbing him for being attracted to the neighbour. The fact that he fucked her two days after she left... 

So here's where we're at. The doctor told him that despite what the tests say now he'll need to be tested again in two months to know for certain as the herpes virus can take some time to show up. 

So he can lie sure, pretend it never happened but that means going to see his girlfriend in two weeks and going a month without any risky sexual contact. That requires another series of lies and then what if it turns out positive after the two months. Obviously this seems wrong. 

He can tell her he cheated now without telling her it was the neighbour in order to spare her feelings but is that also wrong because it's not the whole truth?

He can just tell her the truth. 

He can tell her nothing and break up with her. Which will spare her the knowledge he cheated but inexplicably break her heart as she's been nothing but a perfect partner for eight years. 

I'm not gonna weigh in with personal consequences of any of this for Reid. We just honestly don't know what the right thing is to do. Any advice from anyone who might know better than us will be greatly appreciated. ",AskMen,1433924376,[deleted],4,2,True,2015-06-10

"Guys, what would be a good comment/line to approach you in a bar?","Hi! 

I've never had much success when it comes to flirting (I'm terrible at it) and love life. I did make first moves in the past, but it didn't work. 

My friends are very succesful when it comes, flirting and hooking up. I asked them for advice multiple times, but they don't know how to explain - they are natural talents, they gave me unclear advice. 
 

I'm more of an introvert and honestly, I'm afraid I'll sound/look stupid or that I'll annoy people. 


So I decided I will try to change my love life. I'm not looking for serious relationship, I'm just sick of non-existing love life. Completely non-existing.

Do you consider yourself shallow? Am I shallow?,"My friends have told over and over again that they think I'm shallow. If I come off that way then...idk  what to say. I guess I am.

I go to gym 5 days and try to hike about every other weekend. I just love to stay in shape. I feel like people that care about they way they look or about their body, care about themselves more and their lifestyle. They exude more self-confidence that can attribute to other parts of their lives like at work or at home. And I've realized these girls are better looking than other women. I have also mentioned that mainly all guys will notice fit attractive women first and would WANT (not that they will) to talk to that person more rather than someone who is overweight. I don't have anything against overweight people. I love everyone. I just cant picture myself going up to someone that looks unfit with the intention of dating them.

"What is included in ""online dating""?","As a 48 year old guy whose been married for most of 2 decades, I find the male angst towards online dating intriguing.

I was always somewhat socially awkward in high school and college (and beyond) and it negatively affected my dating life.  But when I hit the internet in 1992, it opened up a whole new world of dating for me.

In those days, there weren't ""dating websites"".  But there were message boards and AOL (actually Prodigy when I first started) chat rooms.  I met and dated several women ""online"", but it was never through a dating specific website.  Essentially, the internet opened up a whole new avenue for *meeting* girls that didn't involve approaching them in a bar, bookstore or shopping mall.

Today, it would *seem* that world has exploded.  While I don't think chat rooms are as prevalent as they were in the early days of the internet, you've got tons of message boards and social networking sites that *should* be opening guys up to a much wider audience of single women than I ever had in my day.

So how does that work in today's dating world?  Can't you ""meet"" women through Facebook and Instagram and Reddit and Twitter and have those online relationships evolve into offline dating relationships?  Or are today's internet-aware women not keen to that type of arrangement?

It seems that would be a much better, and perhaps cheaper, alternative than dating and hookup apps.  Is that the case?  If not, why?",AskMen,1433962200,copsgonnacop,21,9,True,2015-06-10

I have been planning my suicide for a while, and called the hotline only to hear that I should focus on the positives, start with what is going well for me, stop focusing on what I cannot control and instead focus on what I can change, and build from there.

WTF, guys! :D

I wanted somebody to listen to me and tell me that everything is going to be OK, not that I have to let go of obsessing over my shortcomings and work to achieve happiness. Accepting the things I do not like about me is too much work!

At any rate, now I am aware that this is literally it. There is literally nothing anybody else can do for me. I literally have no more options. Either I commit suicide (I cannot accept my mediocre life) or do something about it (including accepting my shortcomings). Adapt, evolve, or die. Nobody will solve my problems for me, even if they wanted to!

I have been laughing since yesterday. I have lots of thinking and growing up to do.

How much effort do you put into your platonic relationships?,"27M here.  Just curious how much effort you all put into maintaining your platonic relationships (friendships).  Basically, a lot of my past platonic relationships have felt like they lacked real intimacy or maybe a better way of putting it is that they seem very one-sided.  For the latter in particular, examples are things such as not being invited out/asked to do activities or actually doing the inviting and being told that they are busy with no offer for a different date.  I feel like this kind of relates to dating in the sense that if a person wants to see you, they'll make time for you, but in this sense I'm strictly looking at friendships.  



Maybe these friendships I've had aren't as strong as I've thought they are?  Maybe I'm meeting the wrong people? Maybe there's something wrong with me?  But I think it might just be a case of me needing to taking more initiative in asking people to hang out and being persistent.  (This is particularly hard for me as I have really strong reservations about coming off as pushy but it is something I'm working on).

My boyfriend is gaining weight.. How to discuss this without being a shitlord?,"Synopsis: My boyfriend has always been athletic, hit the gym a few times a week, but has never been ripped and always carried about an extra 10lbs, fine by me. However in the last 6 months he's quit going to the gym and snacks like crazy, candy chips ice cream cookies every night in large quantities. He's gained at least another 20lbs, it's noticable.

In comparison I've always been very thin, and over the course of our relationship have ramped up my fitness. I've got a 6 pack (okay, 4 and a half pack) and I work hard to keep everything looking good. Perhaps I'm what reddit likes to call a shitlord, but the extra weight on him is totally killing my sexual attraction to him (this would be a bigger issue perhaps if he didn't have a lower sex drive than me, so I don't think it's bothersome to him.)

He has made comments before about how he wouldn't care if I gained weight, which makes me feel awful. I have asked if he'd prefer I was softer looking (since o know lots of posters here prefer that) but he assures me he doesn't mind. I have tried encouraging him to go to the gym again, suggesting we weigh ourselves, talking about how I want to eat healthy.. But no initiative on his part. I can't really start cooking diet-style meals for us since I actually need to take in a good amount of calories a day to stay in top of my lifting program. 

**Kinda TL;DR** - Engagement is around the corner for us and I'm not planning to bail because of a belly. But with the rising fame of ""#dadbod"" these days I'm cringing if his sedentary lifestyle continues into the future. What do? In previous threads of this nature people seem to suggest that a promise of increased sex frequency would motivate, but he's not interested in that. I can't diet with him because my body fat percentage is already quite low and I need to eat. We work different schedules so going to the gym with him is out. I bought weights for home and invited him to use them to no avail.

How did you feel when you became a father?,"I've been a father for just over two weeks now. It was the most magical experience I have ever been through and one that I truly loved. I love my son more than words can describe and the love and respect I have for my girlfriend has truly changed for the better. I am so proud of my girlfriend for carrying him for 9 months and giving birth to the most wonderful baby boy. 

But, I could only really take one week off work so I've been back at work for over a week now and I just feel that personally I'm not doing all that much in terms of being a parent because my girlfriend is with him in the night and then through the day whilst I'm at work. I know it is physically impossible for me to be there and help out through the day but I just feel somewhat of a let down really because my girlfriend is doing it all and just getting on with it without much sleep. Don't get me wrong I don't exactly sleep for all that much, but it's certainly more than my girlfriend gets. Did/does anyone else feel this way when they had a child? I know it's something we have to work on and it'll get easier but I just feel like I'm not helping enough and don't want to put most of the pressure on my girlfriend. I hope that makes sense.

Why is this concept of love and happiness so conflicting?,"So I've had some thoughts on the love and relationships thing based on some posts on Reddit I've seen, and my own events IRL. 

It seems a lot of the time for advice and what not I see the recurring theme ""You don't need an SO to make you happy"" ""You don't need the love an SO for your life happiness"" for people who may have issues with it. 

But at the same time I see things saying that having love and being with someone or having a partner are so fulfilling to some. 

It also falls in line with the ""you have to be happy with yourself before you can be happy in a relationship"" rhetoric. 

It just all feels so contradictory. 

I think the best way I'm trying to say this is why is it said you don't need an SO or love to be truly happy, then it's said that love and relationships bring about actual happiness.

As for my friend group though it's primarily dominated by women. I'm not particularly fussed about making new friends, as I have quite a few people I'm close to already, but I'm pretty sociable and when out and about I'll talk to anyone. 

Typically though I get a lot of guys trying to make plans with me or asking if I fancy doing X or Y with them but I'm not particularly interested. My early assumptions was that they're trying to get closer to the group in general as the girls I'm close with are rather attractive but due to how often this occurs I was wondering if this was the case or just normal for guys to try and make friends in their late 20s with other guys.

Have I managed to ruin my friendship with my best friend of 10 years?

As his best man it was my job to organize it and get the rest of the groomsmen on board. However the issue with that was that the rest of the groomsmen all knew each other and were readily in contact with one another, this lead to them organizing most of it with out my help, as well as them deciding on the day that we should meet.  They chose memorial day weekend because they would have the day off to recuperate and i told them that it wouldn't be a good idea for me as I am a cook and in the service industry there is no such thing and having a day off on a national holiday weekend. Long story short I ended up missing the bachelor party that they'd planned and have since been mocked and guilt tripped for being a bad friend by people I don't know but also by my best friend who I genuinely, love and care about. Sadly the last text I sent to one of the other groomsmen was ""go fuck yourself"" I then proceeded to breaking my phone in  a fit of rage, so as far as they're all concerned that's the last time I tried to make contact with them.

I can only date/hookup with women I'm 'meh' about.

So when I get lonely or sad or whatever, I end up going out with them and hooking up... which leads to all sorts of complications, since they're into me and I'm not into them.

My girlfriend is suddenly really distant. Feeling very upset. What should I do?,"My girlfriend, who I asked out about a month and a half ago, and I have been pretty close for our time together. I can't remember a day without a constant flow of messages and snapchats with tonnes of x's, or a night where we haven't messaged 'goodnight babe'.

We met up multiple times in a week, held 'study' sessions (16 years old if that helps), I took her on dates and we genuinely had a good time together.

The other day I met her mother and some of her friends, both for the first time. Throughout the whole day she seemed very distant, even moving away when I reached for her hand, which was unusual since it is usually her who reaches for mine. When I met her mother it seemed to be going well, and while I was kind of awkward around her friends (since I was worrying about a family member who is recently ill) I reckon it was a successful evening. 

However since that day she has been incredibly distant. The x's have disappeared from messages, which seem suddenly very closed off and uninviting. For the first time in a month there wasn't a goodnight text sent last night. I know she is revising and worrying about exams but she has been ever since we started dating, so it can't be that.

I've been messaging her saying stuff along the lines of what was said pre-distancing, but my efforts have proven futile. We have a few dates lined up in the future and some summer plans (movie marathons) which were planned when we were super close. I'm worried that she may be distancing herself and that the relationship may come to an end, which would make me very upset since I genuinely like her and she is the greatest girl I have ever dated. I would hate to lose her and can't bear the thought of her being with someone else - it would kill me inside (however selfish that sounds) (I know I sound like a pussy but hey, I'm being honest here).

How much of a relationship is a job (or a career)?,"I'm pretty bad at dating, at least in the longish term. My longest relationships have never been more than a year and change. 

I am, however, great at committing to career stuff. I have multiple masters degrees, and am close to finishing my PhD. To obtain these degrees, I moved around during my 20s and broke up with girlfriends along the way. I was sad about the breakups shortly after they occurred, but not so much anymore. 

As I near 30, I realize that life is increasingly boring as a single person, and that dating is increasingly a pain in the ass. I have less time than ever, due to both professional and social commitments. Plus, it sucks to invest in something that yields rewards seemingly randomly. 

Anyway, I was thinking that grad school totally sucks, and that dropping out would probably have been a rational decision, but I could have never done that. I would have been deeply ashamed. But with dating, I never get this feeling. I don't feel like a failure for having a failed relationship, and I don't feel like my exes are any worse off (maybe they are?).

So, do I have to start treating relationships like my career for them to work? As in, do I need to deeply value the idea of a long term relationship to maintain one? 

tl;dr: I deeply value my career and will make sacrifices or undergo temporary pain for it. Not so with my relationships. Is this why I can't maintain them?",AskMen,1432676236,nevernotdating,22,36,True,2015-05-26

I'm 18, and when I'm fully erect I can bend my dick into a 90 degree angle from the middle of the shaft...

Reason why I ask, every time I mention this to a friend they are super confused, I tend to bend my dick quite often honestly, because, well... it feels **amazing**...

Do other people's emotions/feelings bleed onto you? What steps did you take to stop it?,"I have lived with my roommate for two years. For the first year and a half he was married to his wife that lived with us. About six months ago, she left him and he spiraled into a deep, dark depression. I didn't know the effect his moods were having on me until I got into a relationship a few months after they seperated. I spent a lot of time with her because it was too much to go home to his negativity every day. After a couple months in the relationship, I noticed that she too started to become depressed. We mutually broke up last week because of this and other circumstances. We are still friends but looking back I realized how much of an effect my roommate's moods had on me and subsequently my relationship with my girlfriend.

I started hooking up with this guy about 3 months ago. What I thought was just going to be one drunken hookup just immediately turned into an every other night thing that always ended in sleepovers, smoking, breakfast etc. We go to different schools and only get to see each other on breaks so we weren't exclusive or anything but definitely really ~vibed~ with each other and I don't think neither of us were hooking up with anyone else.




We come home for summer break and he hits me up, we hang out/bone and he tells me he really likes me blah blah blah. Next night I'm drinking with him, two of his friends and one of my friends (getting pretty shitty) and start talking about dicks, naturally. Everyone's laughing, doing dick impressions and talking about preferences. I say that I really don't like big dicks - I'm really small, they intimidate me and I can't suck them for too long before my jaw starts to ache. That's why I like ""blah blah""s dick, because it's perfectly average. OBVIOUSLY MEANT IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE (for me, I guess). He didn't say anything really and all his friends laughed but I could tell he really took offense to it. He hasn't invited me over in the past few days and only responds with like one or two word answers.



1. Would you be offended if a girl said that to you given the context?



2. How do I reassure him his dick size is perfect and better than ""average"" for me?

I have even talked to him about it, saying that I didn't like her being over everyday because it felt like a 3rd roommate. I asked if he could stay at her place, but she still lives with her parents. With him, it is like talking to a brickwall. He didn't care about what I had to say and now she stays at the apartment even more and when he is gone for work. She showers in the morning then leaves only to return in the afternoon/night when he gets off work. There is never a moment they are separated except for their work schedule. The other day I saw her keys on our dining table and sure enough, she has the key to the apartment. I want to confront him about this, but I'm worried he won't care or see the problem. I could suggest we split the rent and utilities 3 ways, but like I said, I feel like he will continue to be inconsiderate. I don't know what to do, I feel isolated in my own apartment -- always in my room while the love birds take over the livingroom and kitchen at times. I'm nearly 30 years old, I really don't have patience anymore with this situation and love my privacy in my apartment as well. I have tried to be nice and respectful but it is a slap in the face to me when he isn't. What should I say or do?

Edit:  Look, I still consider my roommate as my friend and I'm afraid that this situation ruined things between us.  I'm not trying to cause any problems nor trying to fuck him over.  Sure, requesting she pay rent could be excessive and I can settle with utilities being split.  I just don't like the fact that I have spoke to him about his gf being over all the time and requested he minimize that to a few nights a week, but goes ahead and has her over everyday and night along with giving her a key to the apartment without my knowledge.  I was just trying to get insight on this situation to see if I'm overreacting.  Some disagree with my problem, but I question if you have been in this situation before.  I agreed to a lease with 2 people living there, not an additional that seems to be slowly moving in.  ",AskMen,1431361431,jaacjac,108,102,True,2015-05-11

How sexually satisfied are you in your relationship?,"I believe that very few men are truly 100% satisfied with the frequency, variety, etc. of sex they get in their relationships.  Instead, they take what they can get and try to be happy with it because it is ""better than nothing"".

Do you think people underestimate how much work it takes for a guy to be attractive?,"Long story short: I was talking to a female friend and the conversation went to what's considered attractive in guys and girls. I mentioned that for guys to be seen as above-average, they need to work out a lot and learn the nuances of muscle building. It's hard work yo! My friend countered that guys ""just need to pick up and put down weights and not look like a total fashion mess"" to catch the attention of girls. In her opinion, girls have the real burden because they spent 30 mins putting on makeup and they have to make sure not to eat too many calories.

So here I am thinking... damn, if it all it had to take to be the top 10% of my gender is not eating too much and spending half-hour putting on foundation, I'd take that deal in an instant. Lol. Seems a hell of a lot better than having to dress ""cool"" all the time, project a confident attitude at all times, work out almost every day in the gym to the point where your muscles can't even function the next day, hope that you have good genes to be tall, etc.

Lately I've realized that he isn't as cool as I thought he was, his responses are always the same, he always seems to have the exact same, perfectly calm, emotionless mood. It's weird. He's very vanilla, and I like to get excited and joke around and he's just not like that. How do I tell him I don't want to further anything? I really don't even want to be friends with him.

Guys of reddit. When is the best time to end a FWB relationship?,"I need guys' point of view of when is the best time to end a FWB relationship: before sex or after sex? I am starting to develop feelings for this guy and so it is starting to affect me so I thought it would be best to end it before I/someone gets hurt. 

The thing is I really respect this guy and would never want him to hate me or think anything bad about me when this ends, I also care for him more than I should and it would kill me if I hurt him and hate to see him sad. Our hangouts always involve sex one way or another, that is always a constant. So if/when I end this, it would be when we meet to ""hangout"" but since sex is the constant I am torn between having the talk before or after sex. 

I feel that if I do it before it would really suck for him that we got together and he didn't even get sex, or leave him with blue balls. On the other hand, if I end it after sex, I fear he may think I'm an evil women who got advantage of him just for sex, or think that I ended it cause the sex was bad (which is far from the truth, it's the best sex I've ever had)

How exactly should a guy go about finding women to to pursue sexual/romantic relationships with?,"My post got deleted from AW so I thought I might as well try here. I'm at a point in my life where school and family aren't taking up as much of my time as it used to so I would like to pursue sexual and romantic relationships.
The thing is that a lot of what i've seen on AW and heard from female friends is (seemingly) contradictory and leaves me confused. To break down what i've learned.


1. Approaching women who you aren't already antiquated with can be annoying and put them off because it's comparable to somebody trying to sell you something.

2. If bringing this up to a female friend it's annoying because it feels as if he was just pretending to be your friend and if he was interested he should have made his intentions known from the beginning

3. If you meet a girl or are introduced to one in whatever circumstance making your intentions clear is annoying because it gives the impression that he isn't interested in you as a friend and is just trying to get with you

4. It would be preferable to find someone who you have chemistry with and is compatible with you, which is difficult to do with the barriers above.

We have a history and we're not together anymore, yet the door is still open for the future because we both needed time for ourselves and she's made it clear to me that she isn't interested in anyone right now and is pretty cynical about love in general.

What does it really mean to be conceited? Is it a bad thing? Do I need to change?,"My family, my friends, even my girlfriend say that I'm conceited. That think I brag a lot, etc. Hell, sometimes I even feel like maybe I do.

But is that a bad thing? I'm not even sure that it's bragging. I mean, for an early 20-something, I'd say my life is going pretty good. I have a great job, I make great money. If someone asks me what I've been up to lately, travel is usually the first thing to come to mind. I travel a lot for work, and almost always tack on a few personal days to experience the city. Most of my friends/girlfriend's friends are either in school or working minimum wage jobs, so I guess they think it's bragging when someone asks me what I've been doing lately and I say I've been between San Francisco, Chicago, New York, etc. over the last couple of months.

Do I need to purposely be vague about anything I say? Do I need to lie and say ""not much""? I love to talk to people, but when people ask me questions about my life, I feel like an asshole for answering honestly because, in reality, it's pretty great.

I may have a half-sister that I never knew about. How would you react?,"So a few weeks ago, I noticed that a girl (I'll call her V) commented on one of my dad's posts: ""So daddy when is thos lucky daughter gana see u"".  I went through some of their interactions to find that she's been calling him ""daddy"" and herself ""daughter"" since 2011.  My dad responds to ""daddy"" but never uses the terminology himself.  In one of my dad's happy birthday posts, he includes ""Love you!"" at the end.

Looking at V, she has a rather striking similarity to my older sister.  She is a couple years older than I am, I'm not quite sure when her birth year is, but it's certainly while my parents were together.  I've known V since around high school, she lives in the next neighborhood over.  She is literally one of the worst people I've ever had the displeasure of meeting, and want nothing to do with her.  Her family is unfortunately known for promiscuity. V's sister has four kids, and only knows who three of their dads are.  None of whom were her husband.  Which could lend credence to my dad having slept with her mom in the 90s.  That entire family is batshit crazy.

I really have no idea what to do.  I haven't discussed this with my siblings, or brought it up to either parent.  I don't know if my Mom knows anything about it.

"In a nonviolent sense, you ever sense that other men feel threatened by you? How do you deal with it?","For most of the time since I grew up, it's been a common theme that some guys are butthurt just by my existence, while others enjoy being friends with me quite a bit.

I'm a very ambitious, competitive, driven, successful person with a lot of people who respect me. So, other men can be jealous/envious. I know it's narcissistic to assume others are jealous of oneself, but that doesn't mean it's not true. I can admit when I am jealous of someone else and I'm sure most of you can too. I've actually had good friends tell me they're jealous, but they obviously handle it well. Maybe 10% of people, especially at work or back when I was in school, would become catty and attempt to downplay my accomplishments. They sometimes try to find any little aspect of my lifestyle that they can judge, and then act like it's some sort of glaring flaw with no good explanation behind it. Or if there's a group photo, the cameraman might ""accidentally"" not include me in the photo if I'm on the side of the scene or something. Or if I've been working on a certain challenging project at work, someone might be like ""oh, I thought this other guy was doing that."" As if to say they didn't think I was capable or to show how little they supposedly pay attention to me. Some people can be really petty.

I know it reads like I'm some sort of social pariah whose constant bragging and gloating leaves him isolated. But that's not what's going on, and I don't mean to give that impression, so hear me out. These are little subtleties I notice, and 99% of people are polite to my face, invite me to lunch/hangouts, and laugh at my jokes. I'm not a pariah, I'm not hated, I just feel as though some portion of men feel threatened by my existence and try to find little ways of irritating me or inconveniencing me as a means of taking out their frustration on me.

I'm sure some of you can relate to at least a couple of things I said, and hopefully have some sort of advice for how to deal with it. Cut the catty men out of my life? Assume they're just butthurt and try not to stoop to their level? Try to beat them at their own game? Try not to resent them? Assume I'm the problem and change my behavior/lifestyle?",AskMen,1430061901,[deleted],25,6,True,2015-04-26

How should I respond when a guy asks for my number when I have a boyfriend and am not interested?,"I want to just say no because I'm obviously not interested, but I feel like saying ""No thanks I have a boyfriend"" may be construed as rude and like I'm assuming his motive is to eventually ask me out, which may not be true. But at the same time, I feel like it's naive to think he only wants a friendship. I dunno, I just feel weird messaging another guy when I have a boyfriend when I'm unsure of his intentions so I'd prefer to just say no upfront. 


For background info, a coworker asked for my number and I gave it to him but have replied sparsely to his texts because I don't know what I should be doing or how I should have responded in the first place.

And I've had a guy be very straightforward and ask my number to go out sometime which I declined, but I don't know what to say if a guy doesn't specifically state that he's interested.

What's the reason why people hate being touched? Is it invasion of personal space?

"How to feel good emotions (happiness, enthusiasm, excitement, etc.) if you have been feeling negatively throughout your life?","I am 26 years old. I had a really shitty life growing up: Overprotective, narcissistic, single mom, and no father around. Growing up I felt depressed, hopeless, unsafe, unloved, etc. That's how that bitch of a mother controlled me. That's the hand that I got, and that's why I am where I am right now.

At any rate, two years ago I was an obese ""nice guy"". Over that period I decided to change, lost the weight, and started working on my mental health. Now I am not depressed any more, and am starting to have better boundaries. As such, other people's emotions (both positive and negative) do not leak into me any more. Overcoming negative feelings and feeling positive feelings are now my responsibility 100%. Problem is, I never learned how to feel good on my own, always depended on other people making me feel that way.

So now I do things that are supposedly pleasurable (partying, dancing, being the centre of attention, getting ahead at my job, etc.) and still do not feel happy. In fact, if I try to do so, I get exhausted really quickly.

I talked to my therapist about this and she told me that this is natural. The *nice feelings* part of my brain has not been used much and is very weak, whereas the *negative feelings* one is very strong. I have learned how to control my negative thoughts, but will have to spend time and be very mindful as I slowly develop that positive part of my brain. Sounds a little bull shit to me.

I exercise (run), lift, and eat clean. This is the reason I am feeling neutral, not depressed, 24/7. It's an improvement, but I am still not where I want to be.

My friend (whose party i'm suppose to attend) knows the whole story and everything that had happened. Anyway, for his birthday we plan on going to dinner then going to see the avengers premiere.

No matter what im going to get him something for his birthday, so I'm not going to completely just disregard his birthday because of this.

"Guys, how do I go about this cultural relationship thing?","I have a friend (We'll call her Diane). She's been telling me about her friend (We'll call her Jen), who is my age and single. I am also single at the moment, so we both thought maybe Diane could hook it up. Diane told me that Jen is also only into Vietnamese guys (we're all Vietnamese) so I thought, why not. 

Diane was staying with family, close in location to Jen for a few days. It is a bit of a drive from where I am. Yesterday, I drove down to pick up Diane, as well as meet Jen. Before that, I had never even seen pictures so I was curious. 

Eventually, Diane and I get to Jen's. We kind of get off on the wrong foot. I, for some reason, thought Jen only spoke Vietnamese. She then says something to me in perfect English, and I'm taken aback. It throws me off haha. On the flip side, I bet she thought I only spoke English. 

I'm pretty quiet the whole time. So is Jen. Not much other than awkward bits and pieces of conversation. Jen's mother is there, as well as Diane's mother (the two families know each other). Felt like a very formal, old fashioned kind of thing. Let the two meet under supervision. 

Diane and I go out to lunch and we talk. Apparently she's never seen Jen that quiet before (probably shy/embarassed, understandably). 

We spend the rest of the day hanging out, having fun. We go back to Jen's house. And somehow, I end up staying for dinner. I mean, everyone was really nice. Jen's parents were very hospitable. 

Jen seemed to have also relaxed some. She gave me her glass when mine was empty, talked more than earlier. When I left and said good bye to her, it wasn't like she was cold or trying to get me out the door as fast as possible. I looked at her, and she seemed curious. Maybe interested. 

I think she's attractive. I'd like to go back and get to know her, and I think there is promise there.

Anyone here get through your intense commitment issues?,"The title pretty much says it all.

I've been unable to have a single happily committed relationship thus far in my life (25 year old male). I used to think that I just needed time to find the right woman, one who I'd click with really well, and that once I found her the commitment part would come easy. This is a sentiment many people repeat to me when I mention how I just can't seem to feel ok with dedicating myself to someone. 

Granted, most of my previous relationships weren't stellar and had me thinking that there was someone better out there for me. But the last relationship I was in has convinced me that I have a deeply rooted personal issue with commitment. 

This last girl I dated casually (for over a year) embodied all the things that I am attracted too, she was sexy, smart, funny and kind, just overall a great person. Yet, even knowing all this I would still get physically nauseous when I thought of asking her to be my girlfriend exclusively. The thought of committing even to an awesome woman makes me feel anxious and physically sick.

I ended up breaking up with her because I knew that she deserved a chance to meet someone great who would be able to commit. I couldn't hold on to her knowing that I was hurting her. As stupid as I sound saying this, I miss her like crazy and want to get back together. But I still know that I can't commit.

How do I deal with the pressure to make a living while trying to start over?,"Hello everyone,

I (28M) have recently decided to start my life over again and go back to school after getting a successful career I wasn't passionate about.

I saved up a decent chunk of change to last me well over the 2-4 years so that's not a problem.

In order to go back to school I made some arrangements, moved back to my parents and what not. At the time I didn't care because hey, I am pursuing something I love. But I feel the pressure to end at 2 years and just get a diploma not a degree. 

I see my friends buying houses and getting wives. I feel stuck in a rut of no progress, no lady worth her weight wants to lock down a 28 year old guy living with mom and dad going to school.

My marks are top of the class and I love learning, but I feel more and more like a failure everyday for not being a true ""Man"" and getting things people my age should be getting. What should I do guys?

TL;DR I am back in school and feeling like life is passing me by

I can't 'feel' the music. Any tips?,"**tl;dr: I'm getting frustrated at my inability to progress, and don't know what to focus on - talented dancers/musical redditors; can you give any tips to a beginner dancer with no substantial musical background?**

Mini-rant following - I had a bad time at last night's social dance event and I'm stuck in a rut.

Quick musical background - piano and violin training in my younger years and into my teens and grew up hearing mostly classical music. 

Never really connected to that music, and I stopped playing before I'd became particularly skilled in either instrument.  When I stopped practicing, music ceased to have any part in my life - a lot of problems were happening in my personal life at the time, and I didn't really have friends. My lack of interest meant I never sought to listen to music.

I'm 25 now, and I've suddenly become very fascinated by swing dance (specifically lindy hop) - I love the improvised, spontaneous element and the chill music. However, after 3 months of lessons and going to swing dance social events on a weekly basis, its evident that I cannot for the life of me feel the music, and that dancing is NOT something natural to me - foot work takes me about twice as much time for me to pick up as my peers, my frame collapses quick than a deck of cards once I start dancing, and I always seem to lose the beat of the music part-way through the dance - plus, I feel incredibly uncreative in my ability to string together variations of moves.

I'm starting to get discouraged - I thought I just had to improve my footwork, but I'm stuck on how to feel music/listen to music, which puts me considerably further back on the skill tree than I'd thought. 

More importantly, I guess I'm stuck on how to progress. How the hell am I supposed to learn to feel music? What does that even *mean*?",AskMen,1428746917,Aminobutyric_acid,23,31,True,2015-04-11

"What are your ""no gratitude"" stories?","So today the oldest (I'd hazard a guess at 14ish) of the 3 girls from next door came knocking on our door. My wife answered and was told that their 2 dogs were fighting and they didn't know what to do because their mum was at work.

We've surmised that it is just the girls and the mum.

She went over to check it out and came back after seeing that it was 2 bigger dogs.

I went over and eventually put one dog in the backyard and the other dog in the frontyard.

We'd previously commented on the state of the yards to each other and the interior was pretty much what you'd expect - a complete mess.
Not generally untidy, messy. Stuff strewn all over the place, pots and pans stacked up, having to watch where you step, borderline needing to call Child Protective Services basically.

So I helped out, got everything sorted, the girls messaged their mum and that was that.

Later that day I left to go to the shop, the car was parked on the road partway in front of their house so they (the girls and the mum) saw me hop in and leave and also arrive back.

I made the comment ""I'm kind of annoyed that I know the mum won't come over and say thank you or anything.""

My wife said that she was probably embarrassed about the state of the house and that she was most likely a single mum trying to do her best. She also asked if my mum (also a single mum who raised 3 kids) would ask for help to which I said she probably wouldn't.

I completely understand her point on being embarrassed/not asking for help etc, but if someone helped out my kids I would at the very least write a thank you note to put in their letterbox and I know my mum would too.

Am I out of line being annoyed about this?

Could you realistically date two girls? How can we help?,"Hi. We're two girls in a relationship who both prefer guys. That lead to us starting what we recently learned are poly relationships.

Also, what could we do to help you? If you've only dated one girl at a time in the past how could we make things easier for you when it comes to balancing us, and the needs we have both separately and together?

I(28M) seem to have low Labido in bed with women at the moment... what might cause this?,"A little context here, Since I was about 13/14 I've had very very high sexy drive. I could more or less stay hard for about 4 orgasms in a row without even needing a rest... I loved having sex with women and women loved having it with me, and  But in the past month, I've found I can only last once or some times twice in a session...

This is not good.. Actually its devastating.

So I have this 23 year old smoking hot/cute blonde in my bed tonight, she could be a sports illustrated model easily, she speaks a few languages, and we hit it off, got between the sheets and after first of all failing to last more than 2 minutes... :( I start using my hands, and get her near climax and she turns says to me 'I want you to f**k me now'. 

Now in the past I would have gladly obliged for women half as sexy as her, but i just couldn't turn up for round 2. And then the pressure to get hard made it even worse. I'd just given this beautiful women probably her worst lay in her life... Im probably now just in her regret category. Not someone she'd get excited to see again anyway (Well unless its 'as friends')...

So now I'm looking for reasons, Lately I take a Men's Multi, Spirulina tablets, Magnesium Celate tablets, Protein Shakes after the gym, Vit D and fish oil capsules... but surely they would only help me.

I've been a little depressed lately, due to drama related to an ex girlfriend... but that definitely wouldnt have been something that would affect my labido.

I kinda feel like Austin Powers when he had his Mojo stolen right now. My early 20's self would be in complete disbelief at my lack of performance. 

I used to do a lot more running and cardio... maybe that is a factor, as now I only really do weights...but in the past weights have increased my labido, so that's unlikely to be the case either. 

In the mean time I'm going to increase my cardio and intensity... and look into increasing the amount of foods that help in this area that I eat.",AskMen,1428768706,[deleted],4,0,True,2015-04-11

Last night we all went out for one of our classmates birthday. The whole night I was talking to him and I could tell he was starting to open up to me (maybe due to the alcohol). After the bar we all carpooled to Mc Donalds and we sat in the back holding hands. It seems childish but it makes me smile just thinking about it.

"Hi Men. Please help me see this from your POV. Is he just being a man when he does this? I never had a positive male role model in my life, so I don't know what I should expect in relationships from men.","I have been involved with this man for 5 years, it was long distance, where he lives in Michigan and I in California. We fight a lot, where sometimes he calls me fat (I'm 126 pounds and 5'7"") and has called me stupid several times and other names. I don't feel comfortable sending sexy pictures, and when I refuse, he starts mentioning his ex who would do that all the time. Then I feel really bad cause at the beginning of our relationship, she'd keep coming back for him.

But when he is sweet, he is very very nice. He wants to take care of me and have me move in with him when we get married. I have abusive parents who I am living with temporarily cause I got laid off. It seems like a lucrative offer, but I feel maybe I should straighten my life first. I may join the military too.

My parents dont want me marrying him, but their reasons are wrong- its cause hes a different race, and doesn't have a degree, while I have a MPH and BS. But my parents do want to kinda auction me off in an arranged marriage, so theyre just as bad too. He got a job as a phlebotomist, its nice to see him employed again after 4 years of nonemployment when I was with him.

Does everyone experience problems like this though? I don't know what a healthy relationship is cause I was never exposed to one. My parents fight all the time and are depressed but don't seek treatment. I also don't really know what a good male role model is. I wasn't really close to my dad or mom emotionally. I mean cept it may seem like it cause of the pics from family vacations here and there. But I always felt like they only see me as someone that can give them money.

tl;dr: Should I be patient and see him change, or move on?

Fathers: have you ever had to spend extended periods of time away from your son(s) or leave them entirely? Why and how do you manage?,"Would like opinions from fathers who, for one reason or another, have left their son(s) behind or are otherwise spending an extended (or indefinite) period of time away from them.

I live in a super-conservative, Christian-dominated, culturally-barren state on the east coast and wake up every day feeling more and more suffocated by the scarcity of opportunity, human kindness and general ambition in this area. Thing is, I have a 3-year-old son who I see every other weekend. I love him with all my heart and deeply believe in providing a strong male influence/being a good role model (since my dad wasn't around in my pre-teen and adolescent years for that), so I struggle with my overwhelming personal belief &amp; responsibility in raising him to be a man's man, a real go-getter versus moving to another state in pursuit of a more meaningful way of life. So with that in mind, I'm seeking your input.

How old are you?

How old is/are your boy(s)?

How far away are you from your son(s) and why?

How long are you expecting to be away from them?

Do you still keep in touch with them or visit them on any sort of regular basis? If so, through what means (phone call, Skype, periodic visit in person, etc)?

Has your method of contact and support/reassurance from a distance impacted how they're growing up into well-adjusted men?

How did you feel about leaving them with their mother?

Have/has your son(s) ever asked you why you're not around or resented you for leaving? If not, are you worried they eventually will?

Do you think your decision to leave has/will bode better for you and them in terms of growing up to be confident, successful, wise, intuitive men that know how to pave their own way in the world instead of seeking validation and direction in others?

How, if at all, are you concerned over the way your son will grow into a man with you being gone as opposed to you living within closer proximity?

This is an exercise in obtaining outside perspective on the matter, not a means of excusing myself out of the situation. I have nobody else I can consult in person on such a morally gray area and am exhausted from the abstract feedback loop inside my own head. Any additional views you'd like to offer on young boys growing up to be less than men and/or the lack of strong male role models in our society these days is also welcome, but please keep it civil.

"Have any guys been successful in getting their girlfriends to change their ""lady grooming"" habits?","I recently made a request and got some blowback from it.

I (28) recently expressed my personal preference to her (27) that I prefer for things to be completely clean in the land down under. I told her that I do like what she does now well enough, but that this is my preference, which I think is relevant because I'm the one spending a lot of time down there. I just prefer not to be making out with a mustached vagina, even though overall it's not a big deal.

And if her answer had just been ""I understand that's what you like, but I really don't want to do it, so I'm sorry, but no,"" then I would probably just leave it alone. It's obviously her body and her choice in the end, and I can't argue with that. 

But her response was to talk about how I must've got that preference from watching too much porn, and that's something that only college girls do, and how none of her friends do it either. Basically just attacking my preference as being incorrect.

I found this strange because in the past we have both been willing to change our behaviors to please the other person. If she told me that it really turned her on for me to wax MY pubes, I'd be more than willing to do it. Hell, even if she wanted me to do something I found weird and uncomfortable like stick a banana up my ass during sex, I'd STILL be willing to do it, at least occasionally, just because it drove her wild. 

So why the huge blowback from what seemed like such a simple request? Perhaps she was being defensive because she thinks I don't approve of what she's doing now?

Either way:

**tl;dr:** Any guys have success/failure stories, or just general advice on this seemingly sensitive topic?

Do you keep social media evidence of previous relationships once you've begun seeing someone new?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a few months and we've decided we're interesting in something long-term. His last relationship ended about 8 months ago and he is still friendly with his ex.

I pretend this doesn't make me insecure or bug me at all because I know that I'm in no place to tell him who he can and can't be friends with. I also trust him completely, he's a very good man.

His facebook has a few pictures of them together, they have several comments from her saying how handsome he looks and there are some posts she's made on his wall. My main issue is that now that our friend circles are being merged and I will be introducing him to my family, I feel a little humiliated when my friends look him up. Why do they have to know that his ex thinks he looks damn good in his profile picture or that she loves him and misses him terribly when she goes away for christmas with her family?

Is it wrong of me to ask him to take that stuff down? Would I come off as a jealous girlfriend? Don't get me wrong, I get very insecure looking at her profile (I'm working on this) but this request is genuinely coming from the fact that I feel a little embarrassed with my friends and family seeing those posts. 

I feel like removing evidence of past relationships is kind of a gesture of respect for the new person you're dating. I removed all of mine for that reason. Am I wrong?

Girlfriend of 1 year is getting clingy - making me unattracted and less interested in her.,"When we started dating we had that new-romance and always wanted to be around each other. I would invite her to parties and get-togethers, and she quickly integrated into my social circle. We had sex all the time, which was great. However I've been incredibly busy with exam prep (last year of university), and she's starting to get very clingy. I leave my phone for 30 minutes and come back to at least 2 texts. If I text her she will **always** reply within the minute. She always wants to hang out. If we're not together, she wants to call me every single day.


She values alone time way too often, and now doesn't enjoy going to parties, get-togethers, or the bar anymore. Getting her to come out is like pulling teeth, and she doesn't like me going to the bar without her. I see my friends drastically less because she claims she needs me to herself. I admit I've been a shit friend. She initiates sex way too often. At the start it was great because she's very hot (a stereotypical 9-10 by most), however her clinginess is turning me off and I don't want to put out lately.  I've recently talked to her about the clinginess and she said she's going to work on it, but I feel like I have a second mother lately. She always needs to be in contact with me, she's getting controlling, and I want my space. Is this something you would work on, or walk away from?",AskMen,1427488509,[deleted],23,15,True,2015-03-27

Can we talk about the gender gap in STEM fields?,"I was listening to a discussion on NPR on the ride home last night. It centered around the reasons behind the gender gap and what measures can be taken to bring more women into science and engineering. 
  
  
I get that it would usually be better to have better gender (and ethnic) diversity in the workplace, but at the same time, I don't understand why it's such a big deal. This discussion was female only, so of course they never addressed the opposite gender gap in things like nursing and teaching, but that's even besides the point. 
  
  
In my anecdotal experience, girls were always the top in my class (8 out of the top 10), heavily encouraged to pursue science, and always welcomed in nerdy techy groups, because what kind of idiot doesn't want more girls around? The guys who tried to make it exclusively men were ridiculed for having a 50's mindset and that was that. The NPR discussion notes that there has in fact been a steady increase in women in these fields, and I assume that corresponds with the fact that people that uphold these 50's style stereotypes are aging out of education and society in general. So progress has been made via society, thanks to changing attitudes.
   
  
Discussions like the one I was listening to were frustrating because it feels like STEM oriented men are being demonized for... liking STEM stuff.  Like we're supposed to make space for women while trying to find our own way to be successful. Are men actually harsher on women, or to what degree is that just a change in perception? I found it interesting none of the radio hosts discussed why they themselves chose *not* to go into a STEM field.
  
  
So what is actually preventing women from staying in STEM environments?  

* Sexism definitely does play some part, but I think it's more a problem of *old* (conservative?) men than it is of men in general. I've seen old women reinforce it too. The idea of a 'boys club' seems to be dying out.  


* Maybe the majority of women honestly aren't interested? Is this a bad thing? Are we trying to force genders to be equal when maybe men and women really do generally prefer different fields?  


* Anecdotally, I knew a few girls who cruised through engineering school with the help of white knights, and were crushed by the actually difficulty of the job they were expected to perform. I assume this is a rarity, however.  


* ???  
 
   
 
I'd really like this to start a discussion about the gender gap that's a little less female dominated. I need some better arguments to convince me this is a huge problem than the ones I have been presented.

Is it ok to kiss a girl without asking her permission first?,"""Permission"" sounds a bit formal, but you get the idea. Is this something you have done? Has the girl ever reacted badly? 

Edit: It seems like most people are assuming I'm an insecure man who doesn't want to make the first move...actually, I'm a woman :) The reason I asked this question is an incident that happened the other day - I had gone on a date, had a great time, figured a kiss was coming eventually. He had been giving the signs: touching hands, putting his hand on my waist, stroking back my hair (basically all the stuff you guys said). So yes, I was expecting a kiss, but when he actually did it, I was looking out his window, and when I turned around, he caught me around the waist and went in. Mind you, it was a great kiss and I didn't object, (I sort of liked the dominating attitude), but if I *had* he didn't give me the chance to show the signal. That's why I asked this question.",AskMen,1426131431,[deleted],48,13,True,2015-03-11

A moral gender question: Does she have to just get used to it?,"I have a niece. She's tall and well developed for her age. She wears typically revealing teen clothing when she goes out. When she does, older men sometimes ogle her. She just has the kind of figure that pushes those buttons. It bothers her a great deal. She looked to her father for support, and her father told her, ""Yeah, you're just going to have to get used to that.""

On one hand, I feel for her. I know it makes her feel uncomfortable, and that her father's lack of support makes her feel like she doesn't have someone in her corner. OTOH, I'm a guy. I know what it's like to see a womanly features and really want to look.

I feel like this is an example of something that has wider implications: My sexuality sometimes drives me to act in insensitive ways. To what extent do I stop myself in consideration of women's feelings, and to what extent do I accept my evolutionary innate guy-ness? I feel like the general youthful feminist sentiment you see so much online restricts me and doesn't let me be myself, and that I'm much more comfortable around woman who have grown up to accept that 'boys will be boys' as a fact of life. But is that fair to them?

So, does my niece 'just have to get used to it'? To what extent? Where's the line? What do you guys think?",AskMen,1426137667,Yetanotheraccountlol,183,72,True,2015-03-11

How should I deal with a friend/potential girlfriend who has depression?,"TL;DR - Girl I like has depression and possibly other issues that I honestly don't know how to help her with. It's difficult to get her to talk about these things and I'm at a loss for what I should do.

So I (16/M) know this girl (15?/F) who is diagnosed with depression and tonight, it really showed. She's usually a hyper, fun kind of girl who seems to be all over the place. She's cute and she's into all of these different things. Talking to her about anything serious, however, is a challenge because when you do, she will either nonchalantly ignore you or she'll get awkward and quiet and sad. 

Tonight we were at a restaurant with the cast of my school's musical and I got the opportunity to kind of talk to her a bit without her jumping from one person to the other. She ended up talking to me about a few things and I ultimately learned that she might have anorexia and I really got a perspective on her depression. 

She told me she was diagnosed with depression before, but I had never really seen it until tonight. I also learned about her relationship with her family and how she feels as though she disappoints them and doesn't get a whole lot of support from them. I don't know how much her family knows about what she's going through. I imagine they're aware of her depression, but other than that, I don't really know. 

The anorexia thing was very subtly hinted to me with the way she talked about not wanting to eat her food because she'll definitely get fat (she's super short, petite, and skinny. Not anorexic skinny, but skinny enough to where hearing that was a concern, especially in light of her depression. I could be wrong).
 
Throughout the entire thing, she was quiet and awkward. Her parents were actually at the restaurant with us, sort of looking back every now in then. Not that important to the story because it's not like I saw any sort of negative interaction, but...I digress.

Now...I like this girl. She's super fun to be around and is really nice and cute. I think she likes me too. However, this depression...it's off-putting. I don't really know how to deal with it if I were to get into a relationship or just in general, I guess. I would obviously have to listen to her really well and be there to support her as best and as often as I can, but other than that, I'm at a loss because she doesn't like to talk about these things anyways. I want to help her in any way I can and I could really use some advice.

Anyone else notice that personal hygiene becomes more demanding/difficult as you get older?,"As a kid, looking clean and feeling clean was easy, even when you weren't clean. The only only thing you needed to do is wipe yourself after using the bathroom and take a shower.

But as I slowly get older, it changed. I had to start using deodorant in jr high, and shaved infrequently in high school.

But now being out of college, I have to shave at least every other day otherwise I look like a freak. Electric shavers don't work as well anymore and leaves me with a 5'o clock shadow. I have to be very careful shaving so I don't get razor bumps or rashes. Not shaving creates in grown hairs. My balls sweat all the fucking time. Dandruff grows so quickly that you think it's snowing on my hair. I can feel a spot on my scalp where there's acne growing.  My face has become so oily that it creates it's own dandruff and rashes.  And to top it off, today I recognized that the irritation that's on my shoulder is back acne.

What would be a normal sex-drive for a man over 30?,"I'm in my mid-20's and I've been dating a man who's in his early 40's and we have sex probably 2-3 times a day on average. Some days it's more like 4-5, some days it's just once (but even then he usually still needs to masturbate once or twice). This is the first time I've dated anyone more than 10 years older than me, so I was quite shocked to realize that I'm the one that struggles to keep up with him. I have a pretty healthy sexual appetite, but I never imagined 4-5 times a day would be possible.

If you're over 30 and dating / married how often do you (or would you like to ideally) have sex with your partner? Also how long have you been together? For the single men what's your libido like?

Is it normal to be a man without any male friends?,"Ever since I started college, I've noticed that pretty much all of my friends are female. Seeing as I'm a nerd, my interests don't really align with typical guy interests like partying, sports, etc. However, I can't even get along with the nerds that I meet in college, since many of them are too introverted and antisocial even for me. To be honest, pretty much all of the guys I've met are boorish, rude, or who I have nothing in common with. My roommates were both athletes and living with them was complete hell as they blasted crappy rap music, bullied me for playing video games, and called me an ""honorary bitch"" for having female friends. Thankfully, I live in a single room now. And before you say I need to get out more, I go to a very small school with just over 1000 students, so I'm kind of running out of people to meet. I find it easier to deal with girls because I don't need to worry about alpha male posturing, negging, and other nonsense. Most of my female friends are fellow geeks/nerds and a few athletes who I play sports with for fun. And before you accuse me of being stuck in the friendzone with all of them, consider the fact that I have a girlfriend, and I've actually friendzoned some of my female friends. Is it normal or even healthy to be a guy with literally no male friends? I'm worried that I may be setting myself up for a future of not getting along with my fellow gender, and only being comfortable around girls. Already, I've noticed how much more relaxed I am around girls than guys, when I feel like it should be the opposite. I actually used to fear women a lot during high school, but only during the past few months have I been able to ask girls to hang out without fearing rejection.",AskMen,1426210332,iaskedforthis,27,6,True,2015-03-12
I'm potentially failing university. What can I do next if I fail out?,"Last academic year I passed my necessary courses to get into university, and consequently failed out. I attended 3 weeks of uni, fell into a pit of depression and flunked.

I picked myself up, got a stern talking to from my mum and reapplied to a cheaper, better university with a more relevant course to my interests (computer science).

I fucked up my first semester by not attending and screwing my finances. I fell into the same pit as the previous year, realised it, worked my ass off for my exams but managed to fail 40 out of 60 credits.

For the record this is UK based, and you take 120 credits each year. If you fail more than 60 credits you cannot retake any exams and are forced to resit the year.

I've began to commit myself fully to uni now that I'm in my second semester but I'm potentially looking at failing come the summer. If I fail more than 20 credits this semester I'm fucked, I cannot resit (financing problems, long story) so I'll have to look for a job without a degree etc.

I'm currently working through 60 credits and feeling extremely uncomfortable with 20 of them (1 module, math based algorithm functions and problem solving). I'm working towards getting them, but it's gonna be a stretch. The content doesn't click with me, I've tried for hours and it just doesn't work in my head.

I need some advice on both *studying effectively* and *if I fail out of uni, what are my options? Can anybody offer some insight?*

**TLDR**; I'm a god awful student who got a reality check too late. I can still pass, highly likely that I will fail. I need some advice on what kind of jobs I can look at and any steps I can take after leaving uni, in the event that I can't continue into my second year.

Some info about me and my experience:

- Built my own computer, high interest in PCs (both software and hardware)

- I love info security and tinkering with viruses etc. I've infected myself with a whole host of shit so I can learn how to remove it manually (ransomware, adware, keylogger, infostealers, you name it I've removed it).

- Aiming to become a web developer and I spend the majority of my free time developing irrelevant stuff to entertain myself. I uninstalled steam to make sure I can't distract myself for 15+ hours a day.

- High work ethic when I'm in a job. I worked in a kitchen (assistant to line chef) and loved it, it kept me busy both physically and mentally.

- I've worked as a freelance writer in the tech field for the past 5 years, creating content for a variety of blogs and businesses. Not sure if this is helpful.

How should I respond to this offer?,"A little back story. I asked this girl out. She said no. We remained friends. Afterwards, there were some instances where she treated me badly, and I decided to distance myself from her. In addition to that, it got to the point where I felt used by her, adding to that motivation to distance myself.

Until today, we had not contacted each other in about a month. I don't know about her, but I've been content just doing my own thing. 

Today, she comes up to me, and asks me if I want to go to a club tomorrow night with some mutual friends (both women and taken). Her stated reason, our friends won't drink that much, she wants to though, and she wants someone to drink with. 

I was kind of surprised, because her previous M.O was when she needed something from me, she'd go through my roommate (another mutual friend) and she actually asked me directly today. 

I'm leaning towards declining right now. The past history, and just the fact that I'm not really interested anymore. The club is in the city, a fair distance to travel, so I'd be committed for the night. But perhaps this is an olive branch, and I do want to give it fair consideration and thought.

 i have never felt this pent up before and masturbating really doesn't cut it anymore. it feels so much better when i get attention from him. i've tried to drop hints like: touching myself, thinking of you;) kind of texts but it's like he doesn't get it or he turns it into dirty jokes that don't lead anywhere. i feel like most guys would pounce at that. 

i get irritated with him now out of nowhere because i'm so frustrated and the thing is we have a really good relationship that lately i feel like i'm constantly second guessing everything. i don't want to think he's cheating, but if he's not doing it with me then who's doing things with? i don't want to beg him or for it to be a reoccurring problem. how do i approach the situation?

How to politely reject a woman's advances?,"Over the past year, I've been going to the gym consistently and I've gained about 20-25 pounds of muscle.

Even women who were platonic friends with me have suddenly been acting really flirty.

Personally, I've never considered myself to be good-looking and while I have been in relationships in the past, it's always involved me pursuing the woman that I'm interested in, not the other way around.

Rekindling with former casual date/hook up?,"Have you ever been in a situation where you were casually dating/hooking up with a girl and things ended, then after several months of no contact they got back in touch with you and wanted to see you? How did you feel about it, and what did you do? Or if you haven't been in the situation, how do you think that you would feel/react?

To give a more specific example...girl and guy hung out for about 3 months, and that was a little bit of stuff like going to dinner/hanging out at bars/watching movies, but it was mostly getting together late at night on Saturdays and ""hooking up"" (no sex, just oral/making out/ect) and spending the night cuddling. After that time, the guy pretty much faded out on the girl because they weren't looking for the same things (guy wasn't looking to get into a relationship, girl was...girl was a virgin and didn't feel ready to have sex with no commitment, guy wanted to). Things didn't really end on bad terms though, the last interaction a few weeks after the fade out was just a random friendly chat, and then from there no more contact. Would it come off as pathetic/weird for the girl, who has been sort of regretting her perspective on things at the time, to contact him (six months after the fact) and try to get together again and maybe take things further?

Questions about lack of motivation (Between Sleep and PMO),"**For those of you who don't know what PMO is, it's terminology used in the /r/noFap subreddit, that stands for Porn - Masturbation - Orgasm. Not entirely important, but I figured it'd be asked, so I wanted to get it out of the way.**

Hey, guys. I'll go ahead and post the question here, so that those of you who don't want to read my walls of text won't be forced to do so.

**Have you, or do you know of anyone who suffers from a severe lack of motivation from a sleep deficiency, or from daily ejaculation? If so, has your life improved greatly since you started sleeping more and regularly, or after abstaining from PMO?**

There's a good reason this question is labeled NSFW. There it is. Right there. That's all the detail I'm going to go into.

Right, then! I'd just like to say that I'm a bit of a heavier guy. Smart when I need to be, has trouble getting his homework in, only has had one girlfriend in 22 years of life, and that crashed soon after take off. There were no survivors. (I'm so sorry, this is what I get for writing crap at 12 in the morning.) In the past, I have experimented with /r/noFap, and as a result, my nights of sleep during those periods have extended from 4 to 6 hours of full sleep to 8 or more. 

When I'm participating in both full nights' rest and abstinance from PMO, I feel amazing. I feel motivated, I feel like I could take on the world one shot at a time. When I crash, though, I crash hard. I've lived for nearly 22 years without any kind of control or willpower, and that kind of thing takes a lot to build up.

Recently, I find myself as I often do; fat, alone, and unhappy about it. So, here I am, on a whim, trying it again. This time, though, I am looking to hear other guys' stories about it, if you have any. Just to reiterate, has increased/regular sleep increased your overall motivation? Has abstaining from nightly ejaculation done so? Have both worked? I'm genuinely curious if other guys feel the same way about it.

I'm also hoping to find ways to improve my dating life (there are subreddits for that, though) my overall health (goodbye snickers) and my willpower overall. That's for a different post, though.",AskMen,1424845755,Wandering_Saint,5,3,True,2015-02-24

What is attractive in a (not pretty) 17 year old girl?,"(Edited this a bit to be more clear.)  
I'm a 17 year old girl, but I'm not pretty, and really rather awkward in public. I don't wear make-up because it's a huge and expensive pain, and I find it to be misleading. I was asked out on a date once a few years ago, but I told him no because he was a jerk to people and I wasn't really ready for a relationship, anyway (I felt really, really bad about rejecting him, though).  
I suppose I'm sort of asking for relationship advice - what sort of things should I make obvious about myself to attract a guy? My eyes are pretty but they're hidden behind glasses, my hair is very soft and I like to keep it long, but I'm overweight (not extremely, but by a bit). Working on that should be easy enough (I've done it before, I've just let myself go, I guess) but having an attractive body has just never been in the cards for me.  
So, personality, guys - what do you like? I'm very straight-forward, love to make people laugh, hate to make people sad, and I won't hold back my opinion if you ask me a question (I hate when people don't give straight answers). I really enjoy stuff like tanks, muscle cars (I have two, a '72 Roadrunner GTX and a '68 Dodge Charger RT) video games, books (and not romance novels; think David Drake), scary movies, camping, history, and animals.
tl;dr: What should I do to find a nice guy with what I have? I'm open to questions if they'll help any.",AskMen,1424849675,Dibba666,44,0,True,2015-02-24

See, I've a 55 y/o professor, let's call him 
Dr. H, that teaches heat transfer, among other things. He's very knowledgeable, a genuine expert in his field, tall, good looking, well dressed, charismatic, helpful, and he teaches so well that you'll learn it even if you're not paying attention at the class. His exams aren't easy, but not overly difficult as well, and he's not the kind of professor to donate grades. I recently had a class with him last semester and I liked him so much that I've taken a project with him, and he's very helpful. And I can really say that, if I was a girl, I'd totally fuck him. So, I told my friend this, and he said he's heard this from another guy as well, so I wondered if he's popular among the girls. Today, as I was walking back from a lab with my lab partner who is a female friend of mine, we saw a girl classmate of ours. My lab partner said ""she's so hot, if I was a guy I'd totally marry her."" I said ""Yeah. And if I was a girl, I'd totally marry Dr. H."" She said ""Oh yeah, he's SO GOOD, I hear his son's hot like him."" So yeah, he's probably popular among the girls, I'd ask more girls but I'm not that friendly with any of them.

Should i sleep with my close friend?,"About a year or so ago i liked this guy i worked with but he was in a relationship(3 years) at the time so nothing ever happened and we were just close friends. He was very loyal to his girlfriend and i never ever pushed for anything beyond friendship with him. Having said this we spent a lot of time together, messaged frequently, went to concerts with mutual friends(but not with his girlfriend ever) and just got along really well. 

But then he left the company and we stopped seeing each other but kept in touch through messaging...So we kind of drifted a little...

Fast track to yesterday when he messages me out of the blue(after 2 months or so of nothing) and he tells me him and his girlfriend have broken up. I try to get him to talk about it and he says its all fine now, but the no sex thing was hard. 

I agree and just tell him it will get easier. Eventually the conversation turns and he asks if we can sleep together without strings attached? I tell him i want to stay friends and not ruin the friendship and he says that he only asked because we get along well and he would only feel comfortable sleeping with me because he doesnt like the thought of sleeping with randoms.

Personally i think he is just thinking with his dick and just wants sex and he knows ill go for it? maybe? i dunno. I keep suggesting that he finds another lady to have sex with(he's an extremely good looking guy and would not have trouble doing this) so that we can stay as friends. He keeps pushing for us to be friends with benefits but i honestly know i will start to really like him again and im worried about that. 

What should i do?

TL;DR Liked a guy that had a girlfriend, never pushed for anything beyond friendship. Guy broke up with girlfriend and wants to be friends with benefits. (i should mention he is m23 and i'm f24)

How much would it bother you if your SO didn't sleep in the bed with you very often?,"I've been with my husband 10 years and have had nightmare disorder over half my life. That isn't so bad but it's one of the factors that effect my insomnia, which is awful. About a year ago I started physically attacking my husband in my sleep in response to what's happening in my dreams. I've punched, kicked, and BITTEN him in my sleep. Needless to say, I feel horrible about it. It's a called REM sleep wake disorder but at the moment we're not insured so I can't go back to the doctor to try a different medicine. So due to all these things, I tend to sleep on the couch the majority of the time. I only have these episodes during REM sleep so I typically either go to bed with him and snuggle and talk for a bit then leave or go to bed an hour or two before we get up. I know it bothers him but I hate interrupting his sleep. I can't lay still in bed if I'm not tired so I flip flop around and when I do sleep in there all night I wake attacking him. I'm curious how others would feel about their SO rarely sleeping with them (not related to sex but actual sleep, our sex life is great)? Also, any advice on how I can better approach these issues.

How shy am I?Well I am scared in School to raise my Hand because i can't talk that well and am scared to mess up a word and pronaunce it wrong(Not sure how it is called in english).Don't really talk much to People and have Trouble keeping a conversation going. Evry social interaction with smb else i am generally pretty nervous and you can see it.

Well since I'm not ugly and decent looking i guess I managed to get a pretty good looking Girl on a date.(We are going to a Cinema) So naturally eventho I know I Need to learn it someday else Im gonna end up alone simply because of my brain I am scared how it will end up.Don't want it to end up being a complete cringefest where I won't know what to talk about and listening to silence for the majority of the time.I can kiss my first GF bye bye than lol

To paraphrase the immortal words of Whitney Houston: How will I know if (s)he really loves me?,"I‚Äôm in a really REALLY tough position.  I need to find a way to know if a woman really loves me for me instead of my numerous incredibly awesome attributes.  

-----------------------

Right now I‚Äôm dating like 5 (maybe 6, depending on what ‚Äúcounts‚Äù) super models.  I‚Äôm not going to name drop, but you‚Äôd know who they were if I did.  Each and every one of them ‚Äì and a handful of others that I‚Äôm not even dating ‚Äì tell me they‚Äôre absolutely in love with me.

----------------------


But they could just be in it for my money.  My wealth is literally incalculable ‚Äì I‚Äôm paying some guys at MIT to build a super computer powerful enough to at least give me some idea.  Suffice to say, were I not such a strict disciplinarian, I could pay off the USA‚Äôs national debt in any given fiscal quarter.  

----------------------------------

Then there‚Äôs my appearance.  My face has a perfect blend of rugged manliness and that feminine thing like Orlando Bloom or young Johnny Depp that women apparently are into.  My body looks like Michelangelo‚Äôs David (except for the penis, obviously) and is twice as hard.  I maintain this incredible physique through tenacious adherence to my disciplined work out regimen ‚Äì I hit the gym for 30 minutes every other week NO MATTER WHAT ‚Äì and participating in the sport I invented, Hog-Shredding.  (Riding a Harley through an obstacle course while simultaneously playing a wicked awesome guitar solo.  I have been world champion for 3 years straight.)

---------------------------------

And of course, there‚Äôs my legendary sexual prowess.  My penis is so large and virile I‚Äôve used my erection to hold up one of my limousines while my chauffer changed the tire.  The Hummer limousine, to be precise.  But I don‚Äôt need my penis to satisfy women, because my tongue is basically prehensile and I have fine-tuned my telekinesis (which I was not born with, but developed through discipline and hard work) to a degree that I can stimulate a woman‚Äôs clitoris, g-spot or p-spot from across my palatial estate.  

Every women I‚Äôve ever been with (a number that is technically calculable, but who has the time, right?) has adamantly insisted that I‚Äôm the best lover she has ever had and there is absolutely no way any of them would be saying that because they know men love to hear it instead of it being true.  I am literally the greatest sexual beast that has ever walked the Earth ‚Äì including the Tyrannosaurus -- and that fact cannot be questioned.  

--------------------------------------

But what about my intellect?  I also have an honorary PhD in English from Oxford College in Brittain because my gramaticals are far superor then those somewhat from Sir Walter Raleigh.    

--------------------------

So the ironicals of this whole situation are not lost in me: I am literally the epitome of perfection in all manly pursuits, yet I simply can NOT figure out how to know if a woman is in love with the real me.  The person I am on the inside: a humble servant of humanity and disciplined musician motorcycle enthusiast.  

Please help?

Should I end things with my GF now or wait until we complete several planned trips over the next two months?,"I have been dating my girlfriend for nearly a year now.  We recently have shifted to a long distance about 6 weeks ago, which has caused me to think deeper about if I could marry her.  I used to think I could marry her but have found myself not sexually attracted to her the last couple months.  I also strongly doubt whether she can ever address her money problems (I helped her get out of consumer spending debt, but she is already back to spending way above her budget).  I also have some concerns of raising a child together because of our political and religious differences (she's catholic, I'm atheist).  Add in the fact we don't know when we might if ever live in the same city again and I'm to the point where its time to end things.

The issue is that we have several big trips coming up.  I'll be visiting her for a week in March, then we have a trip planned to NYC for her birthday weekend two weeks later and finally we are going to California to go camping for 2 weeks at the end of April.  She also has just started her new job and lives in an area where she doesn't know anyone.

I still care about her deeply, but know now that we won't ever get to marriage.

My question for Reddit: should i end things now or wait until after all these trips are done?  Breaking up will crush her (she has said I'm what she lives for) and I'm worried about what will happen to her and how she will handle her job after I end things. 

My initial thought is I should wait until after we finish our trips and she has settled into her job more and has met some people in the new city she lives, but I also don't want to drag things out if that would be worse.

Any advice would be appreciated!!!

I need some advice on approaching a subject about a past relationship with the girlfriend.,"Thanks for reading this small wall of text. I'm 23 [M] and girlfriend is 23 also, been dating for 5 months. Back in high school I had a long term relationship that last about 3 years. Things started to go bad in the relationship and among other things I thought I wanted to be single. There was a girl who showed interest and lead me on pretty hard. Long story short we ended up drunk together at a party and we almost hooked up. I drunkly tried to make a move on her and she said she couldn't do it. So nothing ever happened. It got back around to my girlfriend and that's what caused us to break up finally.

Fast forward 6 years and I'm now an adult and have had relationships since then, one ended up with her actually sleeping with someone else so I know the pain. Since that time in high school I've definitely never even thought about cheating on a girlfriend. I'm a much more mature, level-headed person now and know how terrible it is to have someone do that to you. Here's the thing. My current girlfriend and I got talking about past relationships and I said I've never cheated (technically, I haven't) but have been cheated on. So it got me thinking and I feel like I should be honest with her about what happened in the past. How do I bring it up? I don't want that ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" mentality to carry through because it's not true. I was just young an dumb. Anyways, thanks for reading.

Men over 30, does this hold true of you? Are women more approachable and open now?

Would you (do you) eat vaginal discharge while giving oral to a woman?,"I[20m was giving oral to my girlfriend[20], after a weekend of being separated. I usually do this a few times a week even if nothing else occurs. Oftentimes, she will be wet through her panties and slightly through her pants. However, I have never seen discharge like I did the other day. It was thick and white (slightly yellowish, as opposed to a more clear liquid) and there were two small bits. I'm fairly certain that it's not a product of an infection because we were both virgins before we met. I usually lick my fingers periodically because it turns her on. I didn't want to offend her or make her feel uncomfortable so I ate the discharge. Would you do the same? Is this normal? What could be the reasons for this?

Sex 4-5xs a day. Is this an average or high drive in an SO?,"My SO had 15 partners prior to me. 

I've only had 5 (including him) but his past partners seem like they were a bit, limited, in what they wanted to try-e.g. when I asked him to cum on my tits it was his first time. He'd never cum anywhere outside of a pussy. 

I consider my sex drive average-medium. The other day we had sex 5 times and later he said I have a very high sex drive. 

I am wondering if, despite his number of partners, he may still be sexually limited-experience wise or if this is the general consensus-that sex 4-5 times a day/a girl initiating equals a high sex drive.

Initially she gave pretty short answers and hinted she thought I was being creepy, but I just laughed off her concerns and that seemed to warm her up. We've been talking for 2-3 days now, just a few messages each day.

Last night I finally told her my name. she replied with her name and said that she was going to be deactivating the account soon, but if I want I should call her cell phone (which she included in the message).

She's taken, I have a thing for her, and talking to/interacting with her reminds me of how far away I am from being able to earn the chance of dating someone like her (*like* her, *not* her obvs).  

This is one of the bad ones, guys.  I could easily see myself dating a girl like her and falling hard, and I can't do that with this one and it hurts.  If I ever had a chance I missed it, and I accept responsibility for that (and the circumstances I guess).  So I have to get rid of the one-itis the only way I know how, which is to cut contact.  

I don't really want to delete her number since she does occasionally contact me and ""Who's this?"" is a weird question to ask, but I've no problem unfollowing her on fb, etc.

Making sure a hookup happens? (x-post),"Originally posted this on the r/sex forum but want the opinion of men...

I met this guy last year through a mutual friend. We hit it off and hung out a couple of times. He's hot and I'm very sexually attracted to him. He's a player type so the only thing I'm looking from him is casual sex, that's it. We fooled around the last time we hung out and then it kinda fizzled out. Didn't care, I forgot about him, etc. Last week he texted me out of the blue. It'd been months since we last spoke. He said he feels like he ""owes"" me for last time and wants to do lots of other things too. Woohoo, yes! So I flat-out texted him a few days later saying we should get together because I want to see him. He said either the next day or the day after would be good and I said the day after. So we were supposed to hang out this week but he had work crap he couldn't put off so he said it'd have to be next week. I was like, ok, you said you want to return favors so next week works and he said ok :)

So my question is I want to make sure we actually get together next week. How do I follow-up with him without coming off like a desperate crazy person? I just want to have sex with him, kinda just to get it out of my system and if we never see each other again afterwards I don't care. Just want him at least once, lol.

[Serious] I decided against going to Law School and my parents are furious and on the cusp of kicking me out [22M 2014 Grad] Could use a bit of advice...,"Long-time lurker, first time poster here. For those of you willing to stick it out and read over the following bit, I am genuinely thankful.

Since sophomore year of undergrad, I've had grandiose notions of going to law school. All throughout college, I earned the right grades, made the right contacts, and got the right experience through various, legal internships.

Fast forward a year after graduation, and I've come to the realization that this simply isn't the right path for me. Since beginning to work in law firms several years ago (including the one I'm in right now), and after talking to numerous law students,recent law grads, and practicing attorneys, I've always had this gut feeling that my heart wasn't genuinely in it. I understand that many careers are merely ""tolerable"" for those working in them, but after working in a few different law firms, from public interest clinics to smaller boutique practices, I have no doubt in my mind that I would likely be miserable in the field -- It's a great profession for many, but I  personally do not think it's something I could see myself doing for a couple decades.

When I broke the news to my parents, they were (understandably) outraged. For the last 3 years, I have been telling them that I was going law school and, as indian parents, they were very pleased. My father wants to retire soon, and I would be the last son he would have to put through grad school. They are about to kick me out of the house for (and yes, I did indeed) promising them twice that I was going to finally apply to law school (the first time being during my senior year and the second time the following cycle).

They have offered to pay for my entire legal education, regardless of how ""crappy"" the school is. But financial matters aside, I simply cannot fathom practicing as a lawyer, especially in today's cutthroat, over-saturated market. To make matters worse, I have no Plan B to offer them -- ALL of my previous work experience, referrals, letters of rec, etc. have been somehow related to the field of law.

I am at a loss as to how I should proceed; my mom is angry but my dad is absolutely livid. He will almost certainly kick me out of the house for breaking my promises and betraying his trust for such an extended period of time (he has a point). My current job would only afford me rooming with someone and even then I would be struggling financially, scraping by on near-minimum wage as a legal assistant working in a field that I'm trying desperately to get out of. I don't know what to do and I don't have any friends in the area (and even if I did, I would feel pretty shitty for mooching off of them, even temporarily)...It was naive of me to draw out these expectations for such a ridiculous amount of time, and now I'm paying the price for my stupidity.

Has anyone here fallen in love....slowly?,"Our society puts a big premium on chemistry and infatuation. Knowing from the moment you see someone that they are the love of your life. Even if you don't subscribe to that, many people expect to develop deep feelings for people within two or three months of dating - and if they don't, they see it as a sign that love is not tenable with that person.

But is that always the case? I was reading a page by a psychologist and she listed common ""chemistry myths."" This was number 3:

*Chemistry Myth #3: You can't fall in love with someone you are not immediately excited about. Sometimes love grows slowly, as you get to know someone. Falling in love with the character, lovingness, personality, honor and strength of a person is quite different from falling in love with the outer person: physical appearance, beauty, style and dress.

I'm curious, has anyone here fallen in love with someone over time? Maybe you didn't like them at first, or you found only particular elements of that person attractive?

Girlfriend's mom babies her and it affects our relationship. How do I deal with it?,"I, along with all of my friends and past girlfriends, have always been very independent, so I've had some adjusting to do with my current girlfriend, E. We've been dating just over a year. She lives in another city for school currently, and is on student loans which she pays for, but her parents manage (she has to call them to release the money when she needs it). I've always just brushed it off. I'll often drive up and spend the weekend with her, or pick her up to spend the weekend at my place.


I picked her up on Wednesday - we were going to spend the weekend together for some much needed us time and not inform her parents she was in town, however half-way home her mom calls - a family event came up and she's going to pick E up. She tells her parents she's on her way and is going to spend the weekend with me. The event she had to attend was on Sunday. Because her mom wanted to see her as well, she had to spend Saturday night at her parents watching TV with them. I wanted to see her so I joined them. She was going to spend Sunday at my apartment following the family event, but her mom wanted her home as ""their show"" was on. Her parents are now driving her back Sunday instead of me as well. I don't understand why our entire weekend had to be cancelled - she could have attended Sunday's event and spent the rest of her time with me as we originally planned (and she wanted). My girlfriend just can't stand up to her parents. It would be completely different if she wanted to spend the weekend with them - I would obviously support that and fill my time with friends instead. When she wants to spend it with me, and we initially had plans for her to spend it with me, and then it gets cancelled because her mom said so - I find this a little overbearing when we're both in our early 20's.

"My girlfriend lied about being sexually abused by a past boyfriend, what now?","I met my girlfriend after moving to a new city for an internship. We started hanging out and got a long great. When I first got her back to my bedroom she froze up saying she wasn‚Äôt comfortable. We ended up talking about it and she told me that she only has had sex with two guys in the past, and she was freaking out because she was scared of sex.

After talking to her she told me this elaborate story, about how awful her past boyfriend was. As a result she didn‚Äôt have sex for 3 years. I felt really bad about the whole thing so I brought the whole intimacy thing slowly. It took 4 months, before I even saw her breasts. And it was about a year before we actually had sex. At the time I never once cared because I felt like I was helping her get comfortable.

I started finding inconsistencies with her story over time, but she quickly would correct them, I never thought she would lie about this. It wasn‚Äôt until an acquaintance of mine told me that his friend used to sleep with my girlfriend. I started connecting the dots, and it turns out my girlfriend has lied completely about everything. 

During the entire first two weeks when we were dating, she was hooking up with another guy.

Honestly, I feel like a fucking idiot, I asked her to tell me how many guys she has been with she told me 10+ guys.

* +Pretty redhead
* +Sexually compatible
* +Compatible taste, similar beliefs, personality, and compatible interests
* +Enjoys being around me - (I have Aspergers, Depression, and am overweight. I'm working on the last thing but the other two are serious hurdles.  Still paranoid - with sufficient reason - about whether most non-family enjoy being around me/like me)


* -Very morbidly obese (largely due to abuse and stressful lifestyle). Already has bad health, and can only get worse until things change. I know she *can* lose weight, however.
* -Has a 4-yo daughter, didn't want the child at the time but was borderline raped (long story). [For the record I enjoy children, and she's being raised right so far]
* -Not so great genes and family (lots of deadbeats and not so smart people. I have 130 IQ, none of her family's even been to college)

Anyway a few years ago I met these three guys at a bar. They were funny, cool, and easy to get along with. Especially this one guy. They were roommates. Anyway I went home with them and started fucking around with the one guy. At the time I didn't want a relationship, so we established a FWB.

I started hanging around these guys more, then a few weeks later we were all drinking and I ended up in bed with the second roommate. 

The day after the two of them got into a fight, but I explained to them that it was just sex and we were all friends. They shook hands and understood. 

Then the next week I started fucking with the third roommate. 

It was pretty cool. For about 4 months I just slept with these guys on a rotation. We were all sexually satisfied. There were nights when we'd all just hang out and not even have sex. It was basically like my ultimate sexual fantasy come true. I had three very hot guys to choose from on any given night. There were even a couple of times I'd go to bed with one and wake up with another, which was awesome.

The only thing I regret is that we never did a threesome or foursome. 

I eventually found a boyfriend and moved on, but these guys are still facebook friends.

Just curious, do you think most guys would be okay with an arrangement like this?

And I don't mean just sharing a fuck buddy... I mean having a girl who is a friend have sex with you and the rest of your friends, without anyone getting hurt?",AskMen,1422307584,sexwithnerd,57,0,True,2015-01-26

Maybe because my birthday is so close to Christmas, but few people have ever given me a really satisfactory gift. I mean, some gifts were good, but the older I get, the more I realize, I give myself the best gifts.

So starting this year, I have told all of my friends and family, ""Don't buy me a gift."" At most, I just want to spend time with them, and just to have nice quiet day, with my favorite meal: A steak (London Broil) that I cook, with some steak sauce, ice cream cake, and a nice dark beer (I'm going to try to pick up some Guinness Foreign Extra Stout tomorrow.)  

But aside from that, I really don't want anything. Well, there are things that I want, but I want to get them for me.

"I (26/M) feel like I basically have to tell my Dad to get his shit together, and could use some advice on going through it.","As long as I can remember, my Dad has been a functional alcoholic. He goes to work like the typical 9-to-5 man, then comes home and starts drinking vodka on the rocks. Progressively, over time, it has gotten worse. He used to do things besides work and drink- like played in sports rec leagues, outdoor activities like fishing, etc. Now his life basically consist of working, drinking, watching TV and yard work on weekends. As he has gotten older, and as he has progressed up the ladder of his company, he doesn't work as much, which leaves more time for drinking. So over time I've seen him go from starting to drink at like 7-730pm every night, to now 430-5pm. 

Every night now he is just incoherent and pretty insufferable to be around after he starts drinking. He can't/won't hold regular/logical conversations, slurs, makes constant inappropriate and annoying comments, and in general is just kind of a jackass. 

I just don't know what has driven him to drink like this. I served honorably in the military and soon will be graduating from a very good college; my sister just got her Master's degree and got engaged, in addition to having a very good job at a major television network; and my Mother has always been a faithful and dutiful homemaker that always ensured we had a well functioning household in addition to always taking good care of herself health-wise; and my Dad, frankly, makes boatloads of money. He's always been a hard worker and we have never been in financial trouble, far from it in fact. The point is: we have and always have had a good life. I really can't think of anything wrong with it (except for his drinking). So I just don't know what has made him attached to the bottle. 

It has really put a strain on our family. I was talking to my sister about her engagement, and we got into the discussion of children. That is something that will be coming to our lives soon, and we both mentioned how we won't feel comfortable leaving young children unattended around him. It breaks my heart to see my Mother try to have family functions but get embarrassed by his drinking. I've tried bringing up this issue in the past with him in person, but it has never gone well. He just blows up and insist he's not an alcoholic and that I don't know shit. He always wrote letters to me when I was younger and he was displeased with me, so I feel like that is what I should do. A way to just put it all out there. 

Has anyone else had to do something like this? Can you give me some guiding thoughts? As a father-son issue, I wanted some other guys thoughts on this. I don't feel like my sister or mother can effectively address the issue at this point. Me and him still have a special connection on certain levels: we are both war veterans, both into sports, both like the outdoors. It just seemed like a ""man issue"". I drink myself, and part of me feels like ""How can I tell my dad to control his drinking, when I drink myself?""",AskMen,1420949470,Rtstevie,5,10,True,2015-01-10

Question about clipper sizes.,"So you know when you go to get a haircut and they ask you what number you want and you tell them? 

I got a haircut I decided I didn't like when I got home. It was an undercut and it didn't match my face shape with the length they cut it to. Rather than waiting to go back tomorrow, I cut the top of my hair (which was my only problem with the haircut) with the clippers I have at home.

I used a 6. I know some measurements by some brands are different than others, so for specifics, it says (3/4"") 19mm.

**My question, which is probably really stupid, do clippers cut off the given measurement or do they leave it behind?**

"Dating and expectation setting - ""What are we?"" versus ""What I'm looking for"" and other good ways to communicate intentions with guys?","Over a year ago, I went on two dates with a guy and didn't text back - I WAS interested, but got overwhelmed by life. We reconnected in December, and I have gone on 5 dates with this same guy, and finally kissed/slept together on date 5. He's been out of town for 3 weeks over the holidays and coming back into town on Tuesday.

He's a pretty old-fashioned gentlemen type (28/m 23/f) and I'm the one who's accidentally given mixed signals and did the disappearing act the first time, so he's been playing his cards close.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I'm 100% interested in pursuing this further.

I want to do some expectation setting with him and there'w two ways of going about this - the ""what are we?"" talk and the ""what I'm looking for"" talk.  

""What are we?"" feels far too premature here. I was planning on chatting with him the next time we met and straight up saying, ""I'm dating in order to find a committed monogamous relationship. I'm not in any hurry, and I'm attracted to you, I'm interested in you, and I would like to keep seeing you.""

Is there any way to teach men to handle rejection from women properly? They're wrecking it for the rest of us.,"We've *all* been there:

We're at a party or a bar, and have been glancing at the 9 across the room all night, trying to screw up our courage to go over and say hi.  You know the type: her looks and body language turn your brain to mush.  

With one last swig of whatever drink you have, you finally put your feet in motion and amble over to her, plaster on your most charming look and go, ""Hi!?  I mean... how are you?  I mean... um... are you enjoying yourself?""  You try and strike up a conversation, but she's clearly not interested.  You finally get around to asking her to dance or for her number, but as she politely declines, you feel the sting of rejection and the burning shame of having tried and failed.  

Now, instead of wishing her a good night and going about the evening, *some men* through social inability or lack of grace decide to verbally lash out.  ""Whatever, didn't want to talk to you anyhow - you're pussy probably stinks, slut.""

How the hell can we, as men, put a stop to this kind of bullshit?  

This isn't some misguided white-knight attempt to protect her precious feelings.  It's actually hurting the other guys in the room and making it more difficult for *all* of us.  How many times do you figure you, as a woman, could hear this before getting really pissed at men for doing it?  3? 5? A dozen?  It happens *all* the time.  It's gotta stop, and we need to teach men that rejection doesn't matter - there will *always* be another woman to try with.  This isn't a zero-sum game we're playing here - there's plenty to go around, but each time a guy pulls this douchebaggery it damages the dating climate that much more.

How do we do this?  

**Note:** I'm ashamed to say I did this a few times myself when I was younger, and there's no excuse.  ",AskMen,1420993136,throwaway101802,35,0,True,2015-01-11
What's a good male equivalent of an engagement ring? (Sort of x-post from /r/malefashionadvice),"Hi /r/AskMen! Hopefully this is an okay spot for this question.

My boyfriend is planning to propose at some point in next year. When he does, I know that I will get a ring (which I have already seen as it is a family heirloom) and I want to get something fancy in return for my fiance-to-be.

Ideally, I'd like to get him a gift that is in the same spirit as a ring, e.g. something nice to have but necessarily practical or useful (i.e. I'm not interested in buying him nice hiking boots or a new laptop, even though he needs them). I'm thinking about getting him a wallet or cufflinks. **Are these things you would like in this scenario? Would you even like anything?**

Some background in case it's helpful: we are both students in our mid-20s, living comfortably but not lavishly. I'm willing to spend up to $500. Weddings, funerals, and occasional formal dates or parties are the only times we get dressed up.

Tl;dr: I want to get my SO an engagement gift. Thoughts on wallets or cufflinks would be great, or any other gift ideas! Thanks :)

*Edit: Thanks for the answers so far, guys! I really appreciate the thoughtful responses.*

*Edit 2: Thanks, everyone! Lots of good ideas here*. 

*Just to summarize for people new to the thread, here are some of the ideas:*

**Watch (probably not a good option for me), pocket knife/multi-tool, sword (I can promise that this is not going to happen...sorry guys), art, a meaningful book, awesome sports memorabilia from his favorite team, cufflinks, pen, a ring, money clip, pocket watch, liquor, tailored suit/coat, an activity/trip, scrapbook, flask, and various sexual acts**",AskMen,1420994342,PMMeGoodAdvice,170,88,True,2015-01-11

"Women &amp; Men of AskMen, how do current/past relationships affect who you're ""allowed"" to date/be friends with?","

First, some background/ definitions: If person 1 knows person 2 closely, i'm calling that a first degree relationship. If person 2 knows person 3 (unrelated to person 1), then person 1 has a second degree relationship with person 3. (1 would have a third degree relationship with 4 and so on...)


The question: 

a)How many degrees away does someone have to be to ""know"" them.

b) When and how is it different with different kinds of relationships? (Friends/Family/ Dating / Married/ Exes)

(Ex: According to many, it's okay to be friends with an ex when single, but not when dating someone else.)

c) when do you ask the mutual friend if it's okay to pursue a friendship/relationship with the person who is multiple degrees away from you?


Also, please explain situational circumstances, i.e. if person 1 already knew person of whatever # degree before or not, if there is bad blood between people, how well each person knows the others, if they run in the same circles, etc.


For example: If it's not okay to date an ex's best friend but it IS okay to date best friend's ex, what are the rules that dictate that? What tells you when it is/ is not okay to know someone? 


Examples and Partial answers are welcome! Sorry for the complicated wording! I'm not really sure how else to put it.


Note: this is a super general question, but specifically related to college aged people of both genders. My goal is to form a rule or theory that will apply to most relationships so I can know whether it's ok to befriend/ date them without overthinking it. This is not a specific situation.

How would you feel/react if your girlfriend told you that you could sleep around (while she wouldn't)?,"My guy and I are in this situation and he has reacted positively, I'm just curious about how other guys would see this arrangement. 

Basically as we were getting closer he told me he doesn't see sex as wrong and that it would be hard for him to only have sex with me for the rest of his life (we are pre-engaged. Basically he knows I'll say yes and I'm waiting for the surprise proposal). 

I love him so much that I understand his need for sexual variety. We agreed to some rules. 1. Always use protection for intercourse outside of our relationship, no excuses. 2. Never treat them like a girlfriend or give them money (small stuff like food is okay). 3. Keep it completely discrete and don't let me know anything about it unless it's absolutely necessary. 

I will NOT be sleeping with other men, as I have no desire to and he wouldn't be okay with that anyway. He is happy with the rules and says he most likely won't sleep with anyone else because I satisfy him and he doesn't have time, but it's good to know.

"Got a girl's number, now what? I've never gotten this far.","Last evening I went out with my college friends at the bar and met a nice girl. We talked intermittently throughout the night and sort of danced together later. She seemed to like me enough, she laughed at my jokes, etc.

Near the end of the night, I grew a pair of cojones and pulled her aside, said ""Hey I'm leaving soon - but I would kick myself forever if I didn't ask for your number first. Let's see each other again next week.""

**Now here's the questionable part**... she looked kind of uncertain for a second and said ""I can't promise you anything, but sure here's my number."" And she typed it into my phone.

So yay, I successfully got a girl's number. Problem is, her uncertain response has made me really paranoid that she may have just been acting nice and didn't want to turn me down, or was taken aback and didn't have time/willpower to say no. I just don't want to hurt myself anymore.

Should I ask a friend out?,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post to AskMen and to an Ask subreddit in general, so bare with me please.

So, I have a very intelligent, very attractive friend. I've always been very shy and scared around her as she is quite stunning. In fact, our friendship was very distant to start because I was so intimidated by her, and we only became friends through the same circle at work. 

It's been 5 years since then, and I like to think we have a pretty awesome friendship now. I can bounce questions off her, go to lunch, etc. She's focused on her career entirely (well, apart from her new niece), and to my knowledge apart from an encounter with a colleague years ago, she's stayed single. In that time, I've had a girlfriend, who I recently broke up with (in October last year), who she was also friends with, and since then I've been thinking a lot about her.

What do I do? Do I ask her out? Is it too soon since I got out of my relationship? Will she think I am just using her to get over my ex? Anybody got any advice or been in the same situation?

There's... a further complication. We are due to go to holiday together in Italy in July. Not just us mind, with some other friends as well. Obviously, I value her greatly as a friend and I'd like to maintain that friendship and not fuck up this Holiday.

I don't want to keep nagging. How do I help my boyfriend learn to be responsible?,"My boyfriend (23 m) and I (23 f) have been together for 3 1/2 years now. We moved in together 2 months ago and our relationship has deteriorated since.

A bit of back story:  We both graduated university last year. I finished in the spring and was lucky enough to find a great job out of my program and have been working since. He had a couple of courses to finish up and graduated at the end of the summer but hasn't been able to find work in his field yet and had been working a labour job that he just got laid off from.

My issue is that he doesn't do anything!  He won't grocery shop, he won't clean, he wont apply for jobs. I go to work everyday only to come home to a destroyed house and him sitting on the couch or gone at  friend's house. He'll have applied to maybe one job. He never takes the initiative, I have to specifically direct him to do anything otherwise it just doesn't get done. Even when I ask him to, half the time I still end up having to do it. He also always forgets to lock the door when he goes out, which is not okay if I'm coming home to an empty unlocked house in a less than safe neighbourhood. We also haven't had sex since we moved in. He just never tries and if I make a move he can't get it up. I tried to talk to him about it to see if there was anything I could do and he just closed right up and got mad.

I'm turning into a bitter bitch that I don't even recognize because my frustration levels are maxed. All I want is for him to apply for jobs and at least do half of the housework without me having to ask. I feel like he doesn't respect me at all.

I'm looking specifically for a male perspective on this situation, as I think the only way for me to help him is to learn where he's coming from. Is he depressed? Or just lazy? Does he not know what to do? What can I do? I love him so much and want to save this relationship but I am losing my mind.

How do you arrange dates?,"I'm a 24yo bisexual guy. The continual annoyance I have with girls is that I simply find the practical process of arranging a date impossible and I lose interest part way through.

It's a continuous string of girls taking two hours to reply to texts, sometimes a day and then just giving vague unhelpful answers like, ""Let me know when you're around.""

At the moment I'm going through this with a girl. She asked me out, we had a date which went very well. She texted me the following day to say she'd had a great time and wanted to meet up again.

We chatted for a bit and I tried to arrange another time.

I have a full time job, train 3-4 nights a week and have a large network of friends spread across various places. I have a flexible timetable, but it's usually only flexible a week in advance. In a day there's about an hour free when I can actually text people which I use to arrange meeting up. I live in another city. It's an hour on the train, so totally manageable even on a weeknight, but I have to plan in advance.

This works great with friends, but with girls there's all these games being played, and I tend to stop making an effort quite quickly.

To be fair, I've only dated one guy, but he made an effort to inform me when he was free and wouldn't just randomly flake. It was fantastic. For other reasons he was awful and it didn't work out, but on this point fucking amazing.

I'd quite like to be able to date girls every now and again, but it really is getting to the point where I'm feeling, ""Fuck it, I'll be gay.""
